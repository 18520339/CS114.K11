1578434672-4512,Falisha S.,Frustrating,"EDIT:
My original review is below but wanted to update this review to say that the company did reach out to me and sent me replacement screens so I could give it another try. I will say that I am still not ""in love""  with these screens I will say that the replacement screens did go on better and with less dust and trapped air. Thanks to this company for standing by their products and they seem to be holding up quite well.

I appreciated the video showing the installation as well as providing ""guide"" stickers which are also very useful. Unfortunately this item has to be returned because I have never had any issues installing a screen protector before but after several attempts with this one, I was unable to eliminate either bubbles or dust. Unfortunately I was persuaded to purchase this based on amazing reviews I found this product extremely difficult and unfortunately ""re-application"" was not possible due to artifacts becoming stuck to the protector itself which renders the item useless.",1

1578434684-4558,Ctse,Updated to 4 stars after the replacement from the two stars is just for packaging and amazon's shipping.,"Update- 9/17/2016
I received a replacement from SPARIN with video links for installing the screen glass.
This time around the glass fit Good but not perfect. I still feel like there is a bit space uncovered by the screen glass toward the right edges of the ipad pro 9.7.  And the Guide stickers provided with the package isn't used in the installation video, so I skipped that part myself. I wonder how it is used appropriately.
However, the positive aspect of it is there is no air bubbles trapped during the installation. And the biggest plus is, it doesn't hampers the functionality of apple pencil.

Old review:
The screen protector doesn't align well over the ipad screen. It is narrower toward the top and thereby leaves a large gap to one side of the ipad screen. Whats the point of screen protector which doesn't fit well over the ipad? Maybe I got a defective piece. I don't know.  I wrote to Sparin customer care and someone responded with a video link on how to install the protector, which doesn't solve the problem of it not fitting over the ipad screen.
Anyway, I can't recommend this product to anyone. Maybe only if you want to try your luck and get a good piece which fits.
The two stars is just for packaging and amazon's shipping.",1

When I got my iPad 2017, I was slightly disappointed with the amount of fingerprints at the screen got caught. And to make it worse, it Couldn’t be easily wiped off. So I knew I needed screen protector which was not a fingerprint magnet. I’m glad to report that this reduces the amount of fingerprint significantly, and the minor fingerprints that it does catch can be easily wiped off with any cloth or tissue. It just makes your life so much easier.The installation was very easy and it came with microfiber cloths, dry and wet wipes to clean the screen, and dust stickers. It matches the screen perfectly and you can’t even tell the its there after you install it, and it goes well with an iPad case. Great screen protector. Reduces for fingerprints significantly.",1

Came in beautiful package. Install instruction well written. Followed instruction to a ""T"" and had 3 bubbles.  I was able to work one of the 3 out and had to pull up the corner of the screen protector & laid it back and the bubbles worked itself out, but I did have a little corner that wasn't adhered to the iPad screen. It felt thick so I measured it and it is 0.43mm, not 0.30 mm.  It would have still worked, but when I tried the pen, while the ad said it works perfectly, it does not.  If you plan to use the iPad pencil, do not get this screen protector as it does not work. Just for protection it would be fine, but a thinner one would be much better.

After Sparin read my review, I received an email right away form their Customer Service representative that indicated Customer Satisfaction is their #1 goal and I may have received a defective screen protector.  They forwarded a promotional code that allowed me to purchase a replacement at ""No Cost"".  I did so and just installed my new screen protector and this one works perfectly.  Kudos to Sparin for their great customer service, sticking by their product quality and really caring.  New screen protector is a great product.  Only reason for not giving 5 stars is, I wish the screen protector was a little thinner but it's fine.",1

The instructions for installation are thorough, and everything you need for a great install is inside the box.the entire process took less than 3 minutes. It would have been much faster, but I am a perfectionist when it comes to placement. They actually have guide tab stickers to help you set the product into place before removing the film from the glass, which allows you to make certain the placement is perfect. Once, pressed into place, air bubbles are easily smoothed out. The finished install looks amazing, and since it is glass, it provides a great feel, unlike the rubbery plastic ones.

I purchased one of these for my daughter's new smartphone, and after having such a fantastic experience with it, I bought one for every electronic device in my house. I am absolutely astonished by the quality of this product, not to mention the amazing price point.",1

1578435911-9072,JOHN in CA,Screen fits great and is invisible once on to looks and touch.,"Finally got around to put this on the wife's iPad Pro. I did give it 5 stars because once it was on it fit perfect and more important you don't know it's there and the touch of the iPad was unchanged with it on. I think the wife has already forgotten there's a screen protector on her iPad. The install directions they give you suck, though you do get all the materials you'll need to clean the iPad screen before putting it on.  Also the video they direct you to doesn't exactly match the procedure in the instructions, but this isn't rocket science stuff and you can figure it out. They (and other vendors with videos on YouTube apparently do too) give you a few adhesive strips to make a hinge between the iPad case and the screen protector, so after cleaning the iPad screen you just fold over the protector which will because of these hinges lay perfectly back in the position you so carefully matched up with the iPad screen. In my case, in the process of laying the protector back into this perfect position, both adhesive strips let loose and I was on my own! - to just lay it back in position. Fortunately, if you're careful, you can pull the screen back up if it's not laying down in perfect position. In my case this was about 3 or 4 tries. Then I was left with two bubbles. Again though, pulling up carefully you can pull back to the bubbles and lay the screen down while squeezing the bubbles out. As I said above, once you do this, you won't know it's on there, but you now have the satisfaction of providing some protection to a fairly expensive device.",1

1578434703-4627,Naturephotoguy,Ignore dust particle unless you are OCD,"Followed installation instructions exactly, but discovered a dust particle that my meticulous (or so I thought) pre-cleaning failed to remove after the protector was in place. I thought it would drive me nuts, but the adhesive closed around the dust particle so that unless I'm actively looking for it, it's unnoticeable. Reading the experiences of other users also convinced me that trying to remove the particle would be worse than just leaving it alone. Screen has a great feel to it and is nearly as sensitive to touch as the unprotected screen. Color me satisfied. Love that the bottom button is left uncovered so that fingerprint ID works.",1

1578434664-4490,Jennifer F.,Don't count on gliding stickers. UPDATE!,"So much for gliding stickers. Mine came off as I was gently putting the glass over my iPad, which then messed up my alignment, which then led to me having to try to fix the issue and in turn getting dust attached to the adhesive side of the screen! Tons of bubbles resulted. Giving it two stars because it did seem like it would have fit beautifully and it was packaged well. Overall, disappointed.

UPDATE: Sparin contacted me immediately after my review and offered to send me another screen protector free of charge with some suggestions of how to change my method. Basically I did not use the guide stickers this time (peeled back half, aligned, pulled back other half, then ran my finger down the middle to allow it to adhere). This method worked MUCH better. I suggest doing this, or if you really want to use the hinge method to use additional tape and not the guide stickers provided. Great customer service though! Product itself is really good - fit is great, screen works perfectly.",1

After about a day, I noticed some bubbling in the top right corner. After I looked closer, the bubbling was caused by a crack which had developed along the top right corner. The crack doesn’t hinder use of my iPad but it is definitely noticeable. I would have hoped for a longer lasting protector than just 24 hours - and I haven’t even dropped it! I have read other reviews and I hope their customer service will see this and connect with me. I would be glad to change/update my review if I can get a replacement which holds up longer than one day of use!",0

1578434718-4685,Amazon Customer,Typical protector,"This is a typical self-sticking screen protector.  Nothing too great or too bad.  While obviously you have to be very careful with dust, the only other practical advice I have is to use all three stickers as a hinge because two stickers alone are not sticky enough to keep hold of the protector when you are peeling off the film.  Peel even a little too fast and the ""sticker hinge"" will let go of the protector.  I haven't had it long enough to judge the actual efficacy of the glass protector itself.",0

1578434783-4928,D. Henderson,Good Screen Protector,I am very pleased with this screen cover. It arrived on time and is exactly as described. I watched several YouTube videos on installing the screen cover. The videos vary from the written instructions sent with the product. The written instructions were the most helpful. The screen went on smoothly and all the air bubbles smoothed out quickly. It is my guess the negative comments concerning the application of this product were caused by not following the instructions. Having the screen protector is a great comfort as I was concerned over scratches on my new iPad Pro from using a Apple Pencil.,1

1578434682-4548,lockback,One of the easiest applications I've experienced,"Teh YouTube video is a big help.  Watch before to apply the screen protector.

The ""hinges"" really help!  Simple idea that really works.  I still had to adjust as I was placing the protector.
Even after wiping and cleaning the screen I still managed to get a few dust particles caught between the screen and protector.  I peeled the protective screen up and used the sticky ""dust-absorber"" to pull the dust particles off the sticky side of the protector.  Worked like a charm!  Whew!  So all told, once I aligned, hinged, reset, re-cleaned and such - about 20 minutes - and a great finish with my iPod well protected.  Would by again.

I suspect any difficulties I have are due to the fact that I put one of these on once ever couple of years.  So, not much practice.",1

I carefully lifted the screen and touched the dust collector to the dust/fiber and it quickly attached to the dust collector and then I laid the screen back again.  Amazing.

Had a minut alignment issue and solved it then had two large bubbles in the middle of the screen which I worked out per instructions on the videos and it came out absolutely perfect. The screen is  slightly less  sensitive to the touch as it was before the screen protector was applied. Just pay attention to the videos and follow their instructions and you'll have no problems.

1578434924-5453,M Sa,"Nice product, poor instruction, complicated customer service","Purchased it for my iPad pro 9.7. The package is nice and arrived on time. The quality of the protective glass is good. I did not give it a 5 star because of lack of proper instruction for installation in the package. There is only a little piece of paper that tells you how to install it. In all fairness, there is a video on Youtube about this product, but they did not link to that video in the instruction (lack of proper installation takes off one star.)

The second star goes due to poor quality of stickers. There are three stickers that come with package and are supposed to hold the glass in place, but the adhesive on the sticker is so weak that when I wanted to flip over the glass, they came off and the glass did not fall properly on the screen which caused me a huge problem. A lot of dust and lint (BTW, the tissues are not lint free! be careful) stuck to the sticky side of the glass, which created a lot of bubbles. Getting off those dust particles off the glass is very tricky. I used ethyl alcohol and washed it and then blow dried it to clean it. After that I was able to put the glass on the screen properly, the bubble problem was gone but at some places near the edge the glass would not stick to the screen which I do not know why.

I contacted the customer service to see how I can fix it. They did not offer a solution other than ""peel it off and put it back"", although they offered a replacement but they asked too many questions. The iPad was a gift for my wife and I wanted to get it ready for her quickly, so I did not have the time to jump through hoops. That's why I decided to fix it myself and not go with their long process of getting a replacement.

There is another brand that I bought for my other iPad, they had a pretty neat idea of how to place the glass. It is very simple. They use couple of rubber bands to strap around the glass and screen and then put five stickers on to exactly hold the glass in place, after fixing it with stickers, then slowly take off the rubber bands. I recommend try that, finding a couple of rubber bands is not that hard.",0

I don't know of a single incident which may have caused the cracks, but my granddaughter also uses the iPad. I took the screen protector off the iPad using credit cards to slowly lift it. It came off in one piece and there were no cracks in the iPad screen. So I don't know if the cracks in the screen protector were caused by daily use or by some other stress.

Everything was going great- my iPad was nice and clean and everything was ready to go. I peeled the adhesive sticker off the protector and put it on the screen. Everything looked decent except there was a bit of dirt underneath the screen protector. I took it off in an attempt to clean the protector. That's a no go on this one. As soon as I tried to clean it it made the proctector really smudgy and look terrible. This seems like it will be a good screen protector but I would highly recommend making sure you don't have a fan on during installation. I'll be purchasing another to try again. Hopefully I can give his more stars after that.

**Update- Since my last review this company's customer service team reached out to me. They replaced the previous screen protector and gave detailed instructions on how to install. I took my time this time to make sure there was absolutely no dust under the screen protector. This time things went great. The screen protector went on with no problems and does a great job. I would recommend this screen protector- just make sure to take your time to install and be detail oriented. Also, don't have a fan on during installation. Their customer service was great!",1

I did not like the “hinge” style installation method suggested in the video posted to youtube.  The screen protector came off the hinge stickers when in the wide open position during the cleaning portion of the install.  Got the iPad screen cleaned okay after reorienting the screen protector.  After that the install was satisfactory.  There was one corner of the screen protector that would not stick to the iPad at all.  It is unsightly but I don’t notice it while the iPad is in a case.  I have a spare screen protector if something happens to this one.  I will say that the edges of the Sparin are pretty smooth which was something I was concerned about during ordering.

After two months of use the Sparin glass screen protector is still on my new iPad 2018 and it is adhered to the iPad’s screen with no sign of coming lose.  The corner of the Sparin protector that I complained about is has not stuck and probably will not.  I don’t notice it though because the iPad is always in a protective case and that corner is not visible to me or anyone who uses my iPad.  So, that’s no biggy!

Due to my initial review, Locust-US sent me several emails to try to make amends.  I explained to the wonderful Customer Service Representative that there was no need to send a replacement screen protector as when the iPad is installed in the case there is no evidence of the lifted corner.  She was so concerned that she offered me a complementary iPad case.  It was a fine offer so I agreed and I received the case, which is a nice alternative.  So, I have added a star to the rating.

Also, when I use the touchscreen, there is a little give-like it’s slightly lifting up in the middle. I had it on a table to watch videos, and when it wasn’t on the table, it was inside a nice thick cushioned laptop bag. So essentially this has lasted two days, and now I’ll be hitting Best Buy to find a new protector.

1578434692-4590,Leonard H.,Using hinges? Toughest part of application. UPDATE: Their service deserves your business.,"Update to my review this weekend. They have already reached out to me and offered a replacement due to MY being unable to align the screen after removing protective screen. Don’t view this as a fault of the product. See how much they care about their reputation and your satisfaction. It would be a big mistake to go elsewhere is you need this product. BTW I’m sending payment anyway because they deserve it.
Original review: The product was packaged better than any similar items I have ordered online or at a store. The protector itself was exactly what I was hoping for. The instructions and set up kit were well thought out with one problem. The hinges were a poor method of applying the protector to the surface. I spent a lot of time preparing the surface and aligning to protector, but using the sticker hinges caused the device to be misaligned. On the second attempt it was better aligned but had particles underneath (I didn’t clean because it was only up for 15-30 seconds. I wish I had read more reviews about the application. I really want this product. I’ve never used one for more than a day or so because none seemed this quality. So for now I’ll have no protector unless I buy another one of these. I recommend buying one, but read the reviews, especially on using toothpicks. Or use all three stickers on long side maybe (not in instructions).",1

Regardless of whether I use my finger or my Apple Pencil, the screen is smooth and doesn't catch on. My finger and the Pencil just glide (well, it IS tempered glass). The measurements are perfect and the protector sits perfectly around the home button. I tend to forget I even have a screen protector on it. It's amazing. I highly recommend it.

I bought this once in December for a new iPad and when I applied the tempered glass following all the instructions there were two bubbles under the glass that would not go away. I returned that one as I thought maybe I had received a defective one. I purchased another one and just put it on and the same thing happened but this time there were several huge bubbles under the glass that would not go away. I am a tech person and have applied several other tempered glass products to other devices such as iPads and iPhones and have had no issues at all. I am an Amazon prime member and this is one of the worst experiences I have had with a Prime product. I waited a little too long to put the glass on the iPad and so I am past the 30 day periods to return this second one, otherwise I would be returning it too. This product is simply cheap and not made well. Do not waste your money here.",0

1578434903-5376,Nikky,Protects,This screen protector does what it is made to do. I used the kit provided and it applies easily. The company emailed me a link to a video to watch but I didn't need to. It works great. It has not stopped by Apple Pencil from working or my finger. It has a cut out for the home button. So it fits everything I need in a screen protector. The tempered glass does feel thick when you pull it out of the package. That is great for me because I don't want to ruin my screen with my Apple Pencil. I worry about it scratching it when I am quickly taking notes in class. This is thick enough to give it extra protection and everything works just like it did before.

1578434718-4684,Madison Gibson,"Easy, good quality.","Easily compares to the much more expensive tempered glass protectors. Easy to install - #1 tip is to use that dust sticker they give you after cleaning it with the wipes, no fan on, etc. Look straight down at device when applying, not from an angle.  The “hinge” stickers weren’t really needed in my opinion, but is a good concept and I see how it could be helpful. Low smudge for sure, fingerprints are barely noticeable if at all.

However, I cleaned the screen of the tablet and it looked perfect but after I had put the protector on I noticed a few dust specs. I had to lift the screen protector a few times to remove all the dust. Unfortunately this must have done some damage to the edges. There are a few small spots (on the edge) where the protector isn't sticking perfectly to the screen. Logging in with my fingerprints wouldn't work either after I installed the screen protector. I had to re-scan my fingerprints so that the tablet would recognize them. It works now but not as well as it did without protector.",0

1578434664-4488,Sarah,Initially impressed but it cracked after only a couple weeks.,"Initially I was pretty satisfied with this produt because it seemed really durable and was easy to apply. But it didn’t last like I anticipated.
I use my Apple Pencil with my iPad constantly, especially for art, so scratches are something I have to be really careful to avoid because they really interfere with the smoothness of my Pencil strokes. Unfortunately small grains can get underneath the Pencil tip and when I press down on the Pencil, it will scratch the screen. So I have to use a screen protector to prevent scratching the actual screen. I anticipated small scratches like this from Pencil strokes and was fine with it not being totally scratch resistant as long as it protected my iPad and didn’t crack. But after only a couple weeks of using this protector, I found a crack all the way across the screen, and I had my case on it and hadn’t dropped it. I’m not sure what happened, but I’m very let down that this product didn’t last long.",0

Personally, I had minimal problems. Just make sure you clean and dry the screen as directed. In addition, make sure the guide stickers are applied snugly. After application, 3 bubbles remained on the screen.  The smallest disappeared with a little manipulation. The 2 dime-sized ones didn't. I gave up.  However, they were gone the next morning!  The protector is of good quality and crystal clear. Well worth the investment. In addition, the screen protector was shipped in a sturdy box. The protector itself was placed in a sleeve, which was then was placed in a box with padding. This box was then placed in another box for shipping. So in essence, quadruple protection!",1

Dropped the IpadPro AGAIN. This time, almost certain it was the screen that had cracked .... just not in a very visible place. WRONG AGAIN. The tempered glass protector had once again absorbed the impact. The screen was unbroken. Another $150+ saved. VERY VERY happy to have this Sparin product!",1

I was able to apply it with only one bubble that I can't get rid of. Not a deal-breaker for me. The installation is a little strange since you guide the glass with pieces of tape but I guess it makes for an easy installation.

I really like how clean the display looks when compared to my phone that has a plastic protector. The screen is very responsive to the touch with a glass protector, I feel. The protector isn't too thick but is noticeable at an angle or by touch. The protector works fine with my NewTrent keyboard case for the iPad 5.

Pros:
 - Better look and feel than plastic
 - Very responsive to touch
 - No breaks or cracking yet : )

Cons:
 - Air bubbles may not come out",1

The only reason I didn’t give a 5 star is because we just got this one less than two months ago, and it’s alreay cracked in several places again.  That’s the same that happened to the last.  It might be my kids fault, but seems to crack easily.  Better the protector than the screen I guess.",1
1578434687-4561,Stephen R. Kowarsky,Solid Product AND Excellent Support,"I had a plastic screen protector from when I bought the iPad Air about 4 or 5 years ago. IPad still works very well, and now, combined with a new keyboard case when my old one fell part, and this new protector, the whole thing seems new again. This seems to be an excellent product. The screen comes with detailed instructions for a good install. Something went wrong during my install, a stray little particle of something landed on the screen and created a stubborn bubble. Their support was extremely responsive. They walked me through fixing the problem and really stayed on top of the situation. That's a lot of support for such a low-ticket item. Very impressive. I would purchase other things from this company. Seems to be part of a new generations of companies, Chinese I guess, that offer low prices, quality products, AND excellent support to end U.S. users. Basically no trade-off. Hmm. I wonder why we have a trade deficit with China.",1

I purchased one and it lasted a while, before it eventually took the fall and cracked. I then ordered another one, not knowing about the warranty. The second one lasted about seven or eight months before it took another fall and cracked. Both drops were pretty high, but there wasn't a single scratch on my ipad screen, without a case on my ipad. I have an apple pencil and it protects against scratches from everyday writing. When the second one cracked, I contacted sparin, and they responded very quickly and, because I didn't cash in on the first warranty, they sent me two replacements!  The screen protector comes with a very extensive application kit and is shipped in a very sturdy box.",1

1578434707-4642,Amazon Customer,"Good product, but a little harder to install then thought it would be.","I bought this for my new 9.7-inch IPad Pro.  Before the product even arrived, I had received an email from the seller/product company.  The email thanked me for my purchase and also told me how to go online and watch a video of how to install the screen protector.  The email also said to contact the seller if I had any troubles or needed anything.  I thought this was very good customer service to get an email even before the product had arrive.  Usually I find customer service to be very reactive, and this was a very proactive approach which I liked.

After the product arrived, I watched the recommended video, along with a couple of additional videos on how to install the screen saver.  I tried to followed the videos on how to install but I still had a little trouble installing the screen saver.  There are tabs included that you are suppose to stick to the screen saver and the Ipad and use them like a hinge.  However, these tabs did not stick to the Ipad very well and would slip and move.  This would throw off the alignment of the screen saver.  I finally had to get someone to help me and help hold the tabs in place and finally get the screen saver located where I wanted it.  For me it was a little more difficult to install then the videos I had watched, but it wasn't terrible.

Overall the product is good it is now protecting my screen and I don't have any scratches or smudges on the original screen.  Outside of the small difficulty I had installing the screen saver the only other downside I have found is that it adds some glare to the screen that wasn't there before.  Other then that I am happy with the product.",1

1578434762-4846,Andi,So satisfying to look at,"Beautiful application. The steps weren't hard to follow - my only concern was that it was a bit difficult to get some of the bubbles out at the end, I thought maybe they were there for good. The little piece of plastic they give you to get rid of bubbles is a bit flimsy, so I used my credit card inside the screen cleaner fabric and it worked great. I bought this specifically because the iPad screen gets SO fingerprinty and it was too difficult to clean, and this has worked perfectly. I spent a good 5 minutes after installation wiping my hands all over it and ogling at how pretty it is. Even when smudges show up they're so easy to wipe off. I'm super happy with it!",1
1578434869-5253,Amazon Customer,“Hinge” was a great idea!!!,"This is perfect! This is one of the few glass screen protectors that covers edge to edge. I don’t like when they cut the edge short....this one goes right to the edge. I’ve put on a lot of screen protectors and this one was by far the easiest. I was nervous it would be harder since it’s a larger area (not an iPad mini or iPhone). This went right on, straight, no air bubbles, first try!! The best tip the instructions was to create a “hinge” after lining it up properly. The hinge stickers were an awesome addition to the installation pack. I’ve never seen that or tried it but that’s what made it so easy to do. Thank you!",1

Unfortunately, you only get one chance.

1578434661-4476,Beau Chevassus,Video: My Step-by-Step and review,"Video review:

I bought this screen protector because...
1) I serve in developing countries filming for nonprofits (through Knok Studio) and I put a ton of stress on my devices and...
2) I have 2 young children.  Who are also on the road with me, serving in tough-on-technology countries.

So I thought, ""Why not add a 10 dollar added layer of protection to my $400 device?"" Right?

But in the long run I found this iPad screen protector doesn't really add that much to the apparent protection.  For me the amount of 'stickiness' you get (compared to the smooth iPad glass) is not worth it. Plus the possibility of putting this protector on without getting dust underneath is slim to none.  (see end of video and note all the bubbles around the edges... and I followed the instructions meticulously)

Honestly I would simply invest in a quality case that folds over the glass when not in use (like a book).

Do note: For a smart phone, it's different. I would actually suggest a screen protector because a small, phone device is always jostling up against keys in your pocket. iPads and tablets are different; when you're toting them around, they're always covered by the case.

Side note: If it's worth the gamble for you to buy and attempt a perfect, dust-free installation, more power to you. It's nice because if all else fails, there's no glue or sticky residue left on your original screen from this screen protector. So if you choose to peel it off and dispose of it (like I'm going to do most likely), your iPad is back to normal.  That's nice.

Hope this is helpful!

The installation is a little tricky since you have to minimize your skin oil and dust during placement, and you also need to smooth out the bubbles. But I was able to install it with no trace of it even being a separate cover. My iPad's touchscreen is still as responsive as ever, and I've completely forgotten that it's on there at all. The only minor objection I would have is that it is a slightly higher gloss finish, I think, than the original screen. An anti-glare coating would make this an A+ product.

INITIAL REVIEW: Initially I was quite pleased with this screen protector. Much better price than the ones I looked at in stores, sturdy packaging, and reasonably easy to apply following the diagram-based instructions. However, it has since started to peel up in the lower corner. At first it was just at the very edge, but now there is a five or six square inch section that is no longer contacting the screen. I am very careful with my electronics (and have only logged a few dozen hours on this iPad), and have not tested the protective features of this product, so my low scoring review is based simply upon aesthetic dissatisfaction. iPad Pro 9.7 Screen Protector, SPARIN [Tempered Glass] [.3mm / 2.5D] [Ultra Clear High Definition] Screen Protector for iPad Air, iPad Air 2, iPad Pro 9.7 inch (2016 Version),",0

I’d mistakenly bought these thinking there as two in the pack... but there’s just one.  Rather pricey for just one when everyone else offering glass screen protectors for iPad 6/iPad Pro 9.7in at the same price point includes two.

Mine, when it arrived, was shipped in a thinly padded envelope.  The box had a crease in it.  When I initially looked at the screen protector, I didn’t see any cracks or damage so I installed.  The installation went well.  The n stand day, I noticed a big hairline crack. I couldn’t believe my eyes.  This is where the second one would’ve been useful/helpful.  I nearly ordered another different brand when a customer service rep sent me an email asking how the installation went.  I told them that on the second day there was a crack already and that it may have been damaged out of the box.  They quickly sent me a new one.

Would I recommend Sparin?  Yes, to a degree.  Watch the item your wanting to buy.  It seems they list several offerings of the same item but at different prices.  Usually one far more than the other.  And then some with just one when the other has two included.  And some at the same price as the just one.  Very tricky.  I took three stars off for the shipping, the damage and the resulting damage to the screen protector.

It was a simple install that took me 15 minutes. Came out better than any other screen protectors I've installed. And this is my first tempered glass screen protector install. I definitely plan to stick with tempered glass screen protectors, for they are designed to resist the cracking of the device's screen.

1578434672-4516,Cackalacky,Jury's still out on this one ...,"I bought this to put on my son's new iPad 6th Gen tablet. I followed the directions exactly ... washing hands first, putting on the 'hinge' stickers, prepping the surfaces exactly. The iPad's screen was spotless, however when I pulled off the protective film from the backside of the protector, there was a tiny (like microscopic) piece of dust or lint on it (not the iPad screen, the protector). I don't know if it was just bad luck that it got there in that moment, or if it was on the protector to begin with, but it made an ugly bubble once the screen laid down. I had to remove the protector and try again, and it wouldn't come off and there were three new bubbles around the edges - I decided to stop trying to make it perfect, and just live with it. My concern is more of protection than aesthetics - after all this is for my son. None of the bubble are over the screen portion.

I'm usually good with things like alignment and precision, but you almost need to do this in a clean room to get it to work like the pictures and videos show. If I was using this professionally where appearances matter, I wouldn't recommend spending money on this unless you have a professional do it for you. Rather I'd just get a good folding case and be careful with it. But I am hopeful that the value is in how well it protects, and time will tell if that's the case.

Also, if you plan on putting your iPad in a tight-fitting case (my son's is in a keyboard case), I would NOT recommend trying to put the protector on first and then put the iPad in the case. My experience was that caused the protector to shift around.",0

If I hadn't put it on the wrong side and this had happened with the good screen protector part I would not have been happy.

The fifth star was for instructions which came in 2 forms. For people who are print oriented, there were written instructions. For those of us who are more visually oriented, there were instructions on YouTube. (There were cleaning/drying packets included for the screen, too!)

The biggest problem I have with it (hence the 3 stars) is that it considerably increased my screens glare and made it much more reflective.

However, after promptly replying to their email confirming I would love a replacement or refund, I have yet to get a response. I will be very disappointed if they do not follow through with their kind offer as this shows even worse customer service than if they had never contacted me at all.

1578435383-7143,Tikvah,Perfect Fit for New iPad 5th Generation 2017,"The first order of business after ordering any new tablet computer is to give it some screen protection.  This Sparin Tempered Glass screen protector fits the new iPad 5th Generation 2017 perfectly.  With all the included supplies and instructions, you are asssured of getting it on just right.

I did have one little dust spec on the first try, but I was able to gently re-lift the protector and clean it off.  It seems obvious to me that here is where many people make a big mistake by trying to lift the cover much too aggressively. This is VERY thin tempered glass---and can easily be bent too much and shatter.  I lifted one corner just a little and placed a thin piece of cardboard under it. Then I did the same with the other corner.  Now it was ready to be lifted very slowly along the entire long edge. You have to go slow as you give the adhesive a chance to give up its grasp of the screen. You can actually SEE the process.  Don't rush it!

Now that the protector is laying perfectly flat against the screen, it is a much tougher thing than it was when you were trying to bend it a little.  In the course of my former line of work, I handled and installed many many thousands of sheets of tempered glass---and in all that time broke only a couple pieces.  The stuff is very tough---but it does have it's weaknesses:  it doesn't like to be bent and it doesn't like to have its edges hit with steel tools or even other pieces of tempered glass.

The new Sparin protector is nearly invisible on the iPad.  The touch sensitivity of the iPad is not degraded.  At the same time I also added a KHOMO  Carbon Fiber ULTRA Slim Hard Cover for a really sharp look that protects this beautiful Apple product.",1

Just make sure to follow all of the instructions; my first time around I had skipped a step or two and assumed my iPad was clean enough, just to find a bunch of little dust particles all over it.

I had 6 large bubbles under the glass that never resolved. Returned for
Update: mfg saw my review and sent me email offering to provide me with another protector to have me try again. They also suggested I watch several Youtube videos on how to install the screen protector.  Its a good thing I did because the videos provide different instructions than the mfg’s written instruction included with the product. This begs the question, why doesnt the mfg change their instructions? Following the video instructions, I was able to successfully install the screen protector in about 5 minutes.....and it largely installed itself. I had one tiny corner bubble which I eventually was able to rub out using a plastic shim wrapped in the microfiber cloth. Revised my rating to 3 stars",0
1578435486-7500,Angie,Great product,"Got this for my husband and he loves it.
First cover he's tried of many that feels better than the original glass.  Doesn't ""smear"" as much as the original glass.  Can't even tell that there is a screen cover - it looks that good.
Fits inside cases he already had with this screen cover.
Fairly easy to put on the screen - easy to correct if you get bubbles.

I thought the idea with the ""hinges"" was a good idea. However, when I lifted the screen protector up on the hinges to remove the backing - the hinges promptly fell off of the screen protector. So I just eyeballed it and placed it on the screen.

Second - there needs to be some sort of card to help push out bubbles. The directions state that once the protector is affixed to the screen - you just slide your finger up and down along the iPad screen and it will ""automatically attach"" to the screen. Not exactly. I spent several minutes trying to work out the bubbles - and the screen protector is so thick, that I had to exert a lot of pressure to force the bubbles towards the edge - and I was worried about how much pressure I was putting on my new iPad screen.

If I had realized this screen protector was so thick - I probably wouldn't have purchased it. I'm more concerned about protecting from smudges and small scratches - I don't need something this thick.",0

After contacting support regarding the issues I had, I received a prompt response and a replacement product.  This installation went much better, with no stray red fibers. The replacement product also doesn’t seem to have the same attraction to all things dust.

I am changing my rating based on the my revised experience.  Customer service was courteous and prompt.

Because of my initial experience, I am holding back the fifth star.

My original review is below.
———————————————————————-

This appears to be a nice, high quality protector.

Unfortunately the installation is not as they say.

It bubbles, the corners lift, and strange red fibers appeared on the protector itself.

I may have had a bad one.

I did attempt the recommended relift/replace procedure, however the protector attracts dust ( electrostatic ? ) and both sides of the protector became coated with dust.

It does seem to attract dust to the surface, which isn’t helpful.

Unfortunately I cannot rate the durability, as the product was not able to be properly installed.

The last thing I want is a perpetually obscured screen.",1

Humidity climbed to about 66% with the A/C off which should keep the dust down. Went into my office and dusted off the desk I would be working on. Laid down a non skid silicon mat. Cleaned iPad with wet wipe and microfiber cloth. Then cleaned the plastic on the adhesive side the same way before laying over the iPad. Wanted to make sure there was no dust on that either.

Held the protector down and lined it up and attached the three ""Guide Stickers"". Had to do adjust a few times till it was exactly where I wanted it. Lifted the protector up from the opposite side of the guide stickers about two inches and removed the plastic over the adhesive. Laid it back down and it was still lined up perfect. Ran my finger down the middle, like it tells you to do, and it attached itself perfect.

Just to make sure, I rubbed from the middle out with the microfiber cloth, paying extra attention to the edges when I got to the edge.

Done. No dust, no bubbles, etc.",1

However it was a struggle to get it properly applied. I read the instructions, I watched the YouTube videos, so it wasn’t me. The system provided is just not easy to use.

The protector is so slippery that getting it to hold still while you properly apply the “hinges” is almost impossible. I had to retry multiple times. If it moves, it won’t be properly aligned when you actually put it on.

Great care is then needed to get the protector on without reintroducing dust, because there is no remaining handle after you expose the adhesive.

After driving myself half-mad repeatedly peeling the protector off the iPad to attempt yet another cleaning, it broke under the stress and that was that. I dashed off a review detailing my disappointment and was contacted by the seller with an offer to have another go free of charge. I accepted and a few days later I once again pushed my patience to its limit trying to get a clean seal; with a high-powered magnifier and a bright work light I was finally able to chase away nearly every visible speck of dust and got the darned thing to land with a few acceptable blemishes.

As to the product.  Now that the thing is on, I can say it is sized to fit the iPad perfectly.  My Apple Pencil still works with no discernable effect from the glass sheet. And, since I managed to break one before, I can report that even in the unlikely event of breakage, the panel behaves like a automobile windshield and remains intact--no danger of shards or splinters.

Make sure you affix the stickers on FIRMLY to hold the screen in place while you peel off adhesive label before applying screen protector. Mine came off ( my fault) and I needed to reposition them to apply. Kit comes w/ a 3rd extra sticker in case this happens. However, only need 2 to do the job. Mine came out perfectly. I'm very good and patient in following instructions. Attempt this in the morning after you are well rested and had your coffee. Watch and rewatch the video. Take your time!

Installed per instructions and still had a couple of small air bubbles towards the top and 1 spot with a dust particle on the lower left so wasn't the end of the world. The Ipad is in a smart case and is carried in a padded sleeve so it is handled with care. Much to my dismay by Sunday morning it had a spider crack on the right side which spread by the end of the day. When I went to remove the protector it literally chipped when pulling it off.

1578435144-6282,Diane E. Quinn,Patience,I have installed many screen protectors on many different devices. The iPads are the most difficult for me to line up and get right.

1578434678-4539,Pete,This protector literally saved me hundreds of dollars,"A week after buying this I was listening to music on my ipad with headphone plugged in it.  The ipad was sitting on my desk, after half an hour I go and pick up a pen that rolled on the floor, the cord got stuck in the arm rest of my chair and when I turned the chair it yanked the ipad off the desk and it went screen first into the floor and made noise even with headphones on.  My heart sank the second I heard the noise, I pick it up and the first thing I notice are 3 big cracks.  I couldnt tell if it was the protector only or the screen too.  I slowly peeled the protector off and to my relief the screen was in the exact condition as it was when I put the protector on. I figured over time this protector would eventually get a scratch or two if I'm not lucky.  I've put these protectors on all my phones and never once did a drop from a few feet or sometimes even further leave any marks really.  This ipad I bought was only a few weeks old and without this protector I would be spending hundreds on a new screen.

The first thing I did after taking off the cracked protector was to come back here and order another one.  Until it arrives I'm keeping my ipad put away because I really dont want to take the chance of dropping it again on accident.",1

This does the job, and lets all my touches through with no hesitation or need to push hard.

One thing: While I do appreciate the inclusion of the 'installation kit' for guaranteeing an absolutely perfect application of the protector, I find that just by eyeballing it and being halfway dexterous, I can put it on just fine (and perfectly, no bubbles after smoothing it down) with no assistance needed. Same with other screen protectors. It's handy for people who aren't as confident in their fine motor coordination, I get it.

I added the two other stars because after the first review (see below) the shipper/company contacted me with apologies & swiftly sent a free replacement.
I also received it swiftly & had no problems with this replacement.  I would differently use product/company again & also refer.
While waiting I did read some of the other reviews & noticed how many corner bubble issues others we having.  Don’t know if it’s the product or the customer placement of the product. All I know is that I followed the instructions...again to a tee but guess maybe somehow dust was in the corner even though I used the dust protector wipe.
All I can say is that “I’m happy now” & Thank you
Bunny for all your swift help.

First review:
I followed the instructions to a tee however in the left bottom corner of the screen/iPad after placing, I have a bubble that won’t go away. Per the instruction any bubble would go away after a couple days...it’s been WAY over that period ...almost a month.  Beware of Bubbles!!",1

1578434710-4659,Kurt,Sparin screen protector,"Just installed it ... Works fine with your fingers ... Haven't tried the pencil yet.

Installation is a little tricky... I tried to use the hinge method in the directions but the sticky paper wasn't sticky enough and they came loose, so I just placed the screen down using the edges to hold onto and slowly put it into place... It was on right but it had bubbles... I tried to move the bubbles from the center to the edges without much success, so I tried something different... I picked up the left side from the edge using a fingernail at the top and bottom and raised it up enough to create a gap to the middle of the screen and then let the screen protector back down slowly and all the bubbles disappeared.  Did the same thing on the right side with similar results.  Doing it like this doesn't change the alignment of the screen on the iPad since half is still sticking while the other half is relaid from the center out eliminating the bubbles.

Packaging, supplies, product quality ... all first rate.  Screen seems to be extra hard, so it should offer good protection.",1

1578434690-4571,M. R. Borelli,Already cracked after two weeks,Thought this would be a great protector from all the reviews. Apparently I did not get the same experience as most others. I have only had this protector on for two weeks. The instructions and materials that were included were great and I was able to install it without having any air bubbles or dust particles behind it. This is the only reason why I am giving it two stars instead of one. I have not dropped my iPad nor mishandled it in any way. I have actually barely used the iPad since I received it. Not sure what I might have did to cause the crack. The crack goes across the entire width of the screen.,0

Follow the series of short steps to prep the iPad and align the screen using three adhesive strips to keep it aligned...peel the protective sheet from the glass, close the glass cover onto the iPad screen, just like closing the cover of a book, and I did not even have to use the tool to do anything.

1578434661-4480,Mirz,Best screen protector I ever purchased,"Screen protectors have always been a headache to apply for me, even the ones that come with the little microfiber cloth to wipe your screen. You either get unsightly bubbles from dust specks (no matter how much you wipe), or the positioning is off (no matter how much you line it up) - and while you are adjusting it, the underside is attracting dust like there is no tomorrow!

Which is why THIS screen protector is head and shoulders above the rest. It came in the pictured light yellow cardstock folio (kind of like an iPad case)- not necessary but A+ for presentation. It also had a ton of accessories including positioning stickers (no more readjusting!), 3 different kinds of wipes (wet, dry, and microfiber), and a dust removing sticker. The tempered glass itself looks and feels exactly like your shiny new iPad screen so you're not sacrificing visual or tactile sophistication for the sake of protection. And the best part is it's self-adhering - just lightly touch it to your (perfectly clean) screen and watch it work! Barely any extra squeezing or pressing is needed. I followed the instructions exactly and ended up with only one tiny bubble which I pressed out easily, which NEVER happens. I can't recommend this product enough!",1

1578435811-8715,Jim,I cannot recommend this product,"I have learned the hard way that a shopper must be very careful when choosing a screen protector for the various iPads.  Very recently I had purchased a 2017 standard model iPad 9.7 for my wife.  I selected this very Sparin glass screen protector for her unit.  I was very careful when I installed this screen protector and followed any and all instructions as prescribed.  My wife wanted me to mount her iPad into one of those nice cases with the built in blue tooth keyboard.  This I gladly did.  However I soon discovered that this Sparin screen protector was slightly too thick for this keyboard case and one of the leading outside edges was BINDING on the hinge for the top cover.  This caused the screen protector to severely crack thus causing massive bubbles through out the screen coverage area.  Not only was this situation totally unacceptable but I feel dang lucky to be able to remove this dysfunctional screen protector OFF of my wife's iPad before it caused any more damage to her screen.  Another negative anomaly that this Sparin screen protector has is the way or method that this company has set forth as installation instructions.  This is what nightmares are made out of.  Sparin advises the installer to use a sticker tape hinge system so as to help you guide their screen protector in place.  Probably one of the more ridiculous situations I have ever endured when it comes to tasks such as this.  Sparin's entire mounting system needs to be revised or upgraded, not a doubt in my mind.  In addition, once I had removed the dysfunctional screen protector from my wife's iPad, as I was moving it to the garbage can, this entire unit fell apart in both of my hands.  I can tell you honestly that this screen protector is not made all that well.  There is just no way that I can recommend this iPad screen protector and live with myself.  Please allow me to advise you that there ARE good screen protectors on the market, but some of the better ones have a healthy price tag, unfortunately.  This entire fiasco cost me a whole evening's worth of work, I even installed another cheapy flexible screen protector which I had to remove due to mass air bubbles (etc) plus I had to drive 70 miles on very slick roads (today) in order to purchase a GOOD screen protector which eventually solved my problem here.  This was certainly a series of events that I would not like to see my readers go through.  One last thought here.  Just in case you did not know this, the new 2017 iPad 9.7 models ALREADY have an ""Apple installed"" screen protector on them when they ship.  Not quite sure on which models, but my wife's iPad did.  This situation was so problematic for me that I ended up removing the factory screen protector (down to bare glass) and replacing it with the most heavy duty FLEXIBLE (non glass) screen protector that I could get my hands on.  True story.  So be wise and select a GOOD iPad screen protector  I wished there was a way that I could give this product MINUS 5 stars.",0
1578435851-8855,Nathan,Definitely worth the money,"Very easy to install, no bubbles at all. Durable and high quality.",1
1578434916-5423,Andy K,Awesome product at an incredible price!,"I'm only into an hour of having it on my iPad so I don't know if I'll feel the same after prolonged use but so far, this is great.  Install was a snap and probably one of the easiest screen protectors I have ever installed on an electronic device.  The included cleaning and drying wipes were more than sufficient to prep the screen as was the included ""dust absorber.""  The guide stickers look like they'd be a good idea but I ended up not needing them and was still able to get a nice, accurate placement on my iPad.  I have no air bubbles or dust between the screen and screen protector.

No effect on screen resolution that I can see.
- Apple Pencil is as responsive with screen protector in place.
- Fits under my case well (see pic.)  There's a little overlap in some places but doesn't seem like it'll cause any problems with use.
- Price is almost too good to be true.
- Packaging is pretty impressive and ensures you get an intact screen protector.

14 May 2017 addition-  Over four months into using the product and nothing has changed.  It's a great screen protector and is holding up to use unbelievably well.  I did an entire semester of hand-written notes in OneNote so a lot of writing on the screen with my Apple Pencil.  No scratches, scuffs or really any other evidence that I've even used the iPad at all.

My Apple Pencil tip isn't showing any excessive wear but I'm not sure if that's because of the screen protector surface or the durability of the tip.  Either way, there's really no evidence of me writing away on the iPad that shows on the screen protector and the pencil tracks beautifully 100% of the time with no degradation of sensitivity.",1

But even with following the directions very carefully, and with studying the video (link provided inside packaging), item proved woefully flawed/didn't set correctly. Also, the tape stickers proved too weak to hold when peeling back final covering.

Best screen protector I've ever intalled! No spots, no dust, no fingerprints, no bubbles left after swiping them towards the edges. Not a single flaw!
Note: I did wear latex gloves because I tend to have oily skin. And I used the tabs, the wipes  and the dust absorber (basically a type of sitcky tape) as indicated in the directions. I found that my gloved fingers worked better than the little supplied scraper for moving the bubbles out. I ended up with not even a remnant of a bubble. My iPad is beautiful and protected.",1

1578435928-9134,Chandra Sekar J,The protector screen is very thick like extra glass to iPad,"I had some issues while applying this screen protector. I had to remove two times to make it align properly at all the corners. But at the end, it worked. The protector screen is very thick like extra glass to iPad, but doesn't feel like extra prector when used/swiping on the screen.

There is no hole for front camera.  As of now, not much difference since the screen is very new. I hope it doesn't affect camera quality when it became used after a while.

Protector screen came in well packed packaging. Surprised to see that it had very thick folder which I am going to reuse as photo frame :)

Few things I noticed (not big issues.):
1. It could have been little smaller in the edges so that it could be placed properly. For me, in one of the edges it is slightly came off the edge.
2. No hole for front camera.
3. Only one layer is removable in the screen protector . All the screen protector I used till now had two layers 1. one to stick on the screen and 2. another protection cover to protector screen itself.",1
1578434874-5274,tim,Get it right the first time,"When I put on the protector (which did not go well because the guide stickers do not stick and are useless) I ended up with a spot of something between the protector and the iPad. I tried to lift the protector to see if I could remove the speck and the whole protector shattered.

UPDATE: sparin contacted me and requested to send me a free replacement, so I said I would try it again. This time I skipped the guide stickers and just dropped the protector on the screen after I cleaned it all ( with my own cleaners, not the included wipes) and I have to say I am very happy with it. The screen under the protector still looks bright and crisp, and I was able to get all the air bubbles and dust off the glass before i set the protector. It is a great protector once you get it on right, but I can't give anyone much help on how to get it on. I think sparin needs to work on its guide stickers and maybe some of the cleaning wipes. Still, good product overall!",1

1578434661-4479,Jaron,Perfectly clean and clear glass!,"Just received this in the mail today, and all in all I can say I’m content with my purchase. I’ve applied it this afternoon, and after hours of inspecting it, and testing it out it proves to be a great protector. Everything is literally crystal clear, and it looks as if nothing is applied at all. It has a very nice feel to it. My finger feels very comfortable gliding across the glass. It arrived in a book like premium case so it wouldn’t get damaged during shipping and handling which is very great. It also came with clear and easy instructions on how to install it on your iPad. The only thing is that the guidelines didn’t help me all that well, so I chose to install it without it. Now it worked for me because I’m used to installing tempered glass on phones so I know how to install them without additional help, but I’m not trying to discredit their use. They just weren’t for me. My installation came out fine, and I’m happy. Unfortunately after examining it I somehow got a teeny, tiny black spec of debris on the bottom left corner of my iPad, but that was my fault as I was rushing. You’re going to experience bubbles as that’s something that generally happens with all protected but a good firm push right after you apply the protector, and they’ll smooth right out. If I ever need a new protector I’ll definitely re-order from this same company! I have pictures for your convenience.",1

It even came with sticky ""hinges"" for proper positioning after removing the film from the inside of the glass. It adhered to the iPad screen perfectly and the protector feels great. Very smooth to the touch. Extremely happy with the quality and price. I got an iPhone 7 from the Verizon store recently and a similar protector was around $45. Absolutely no difference in quality.",1

My iPencil also works flawlessly as if there was no glass cover. Since it is tempered glass, there is no scratch marks or clouding of this screen protector.

The company is also a joy to work with. I need to have a replacement sent for my husbands glass. He's so cute, but not well trained. All I had to do was email the seller with my request. They answered me immediately! Asked a few questions, and then sent out the new one. The whole process took less than 5 days! That is what I call awesome customer service!

After a month's use there were several scratches on the protector, which is fine because that is its purpose but I wouldn't necessarily say it is scratch resistant.

I had no trouble actually putting it on and I didn’t need all of the extras for help. My issue is that I have lots of pets so flying pet hair IS a huge problem for me. So I had to do some prep work before attempting this. I cleaned my smallest bathroom and turned it into an actual “clean room”. I turned the exhaust fan off and central heat off so NOTHING would be flying around. I put on a full clean room suit, covered my hair and shoes. JUST KIDDING😹, but I did change my clothes so they were fur-free! Then I started the procedure: I cleaned the screen with their clean and dry wipes, then applied the protector as instructed. MOST IMPORTANT PART IS LINING IT UP! You really only get one shot because it will crack if you try to move it so make sure you are on target. Luckily I nailed it the first time and it went right on perfect! There was not a bubble, speck of dirt, or cat/dog fur to be found under the screen! I used the squeegee card to make sure it was completely affixed and VOILA! It is perfect. So most of you will not go to my silly extreme measures, but I have gone thru these things like qtips because of just haphazardly throwing them on. So it was worth the prep time to ensure this one did not end up in the trash. It is shiny and sooo strong and yet all of my touches and stylus work great with no issues. Hope it lasts and I don’t have to go thru this for a long time! Good luck. Let me know if this helpful to anyone.",1

1578434732-4738,Rebecca C.,Great price!,"After a disappointing experience with another screen protector from Best Buy I turned to trusty Amazon for a glass screen protector for my husbands iPad. This one was literally a third of the cost of the one from Best Buy so I figured why not try it. The product arrived well packed and protected, on time of course. Everything I needed to clean the screen and apply the screen protector was included, as well as detailed installation instructions. Within a few minutes it was in place and ready to go. No smudges, no scratches, and it's still every bit as sensitive as the screen was without.  My husband treats the iPad like his baby so we haven't had occasion to test the durability (hopefully we never will lol he may have a heart attack) but this far we are pleased with the product.",1

It's significantly cheaper than purchasing the tempered glass they sell in stores and it comes with a kit that let's you get your iPad completely clean before applying it.

Cleaned the screen, wiped any lint off the cellophane side of the screen protector, taped it down, saw that it would fit just right, then pulled off the cellophane cover.  Seated the glass.  Dang.  Two small bubbles.  Pulled the glass up again, almost all the way, then dropped it on, and poof, bubbles gone.  One tiny one in the corner which was dispensed with the edge of a credit card.  All in all, the installation didn't take ten minutes.  Very happy with this product.

It got a bubble, but I just lifted and put the screen back down till it went away. It does seem to get some smudges on it, but my fingers just seem to smudge screens more overall. I feel really good about the protector if I were to drop it, and the price can’t be beat for the items and support included in the package. The packaging was surprisingly high quality as well.",1

1578434695-4599,OnDaReglah,Quality control an issue. EDIT,"Having put on multiple screen protectors over the years, I set out to put this bad boy on with as much finness as all the rest. Alas, there was clearly dust particles underneath the protective film, rendering it impossible to have a dust free application. It fits perfectly on the iPad and you can’t tell that it is even there (except for the dust particles that were already on the screen protector when I received it). The hinge stickers are useless and make it more difficult. Practice on your own with the adhesive back on the protector first before committing to using them. Would have been a 5 star product but quality control seems to be lacking unfortunately.

Edit: After reaching out to customer service about the damaged product I promptly received a replacement. The replacement was much better. Easy installation and can't even tell that it is on the iPad. Great product, great price, and amazing customer service!",1

Had to lift it up a few times to get the dust particles off but it's really easy to lift off and put back on. Comes in really good packaging too considering the price. I didn't use the guide stickers at all -- they seem like more of a hassle than anything and it's not that hard to line it up without them.,1

1578434678-4531,2 Boxer Mom,Very satisfied and I would recommend to others.,"I am giving 5 stars to the SPARIN Tempered Glass screen protector. I bought it to safeguard my 2017 iPad Air 2. The item was delivered on time and well packaged. The protector itself is so thin it's hard to believe it is glass but it is. The installation was very simple. Clean the glass with the products included and use the sticky film to remove any minute dust or particle and using the adhesive tabs to create a ""book"", peel the film back from the down side of the protector and drop in place.  Make sure to follow the directions and if you need to (I did because I was a little nervous I'd screw it up and must buy another one) follow a tutorial on YouTube. The protector really does adhere itself to the glass and I had only a minor bubble to push aside. It was easier than I thought it would be. The cut outs for the home button, camera, etc. line up perfectly. The thinness of the protector does not in any way interfere with the touch functions of my tablet.  I now feel confident in ordering one for my iPhone 7.",1

1578434713-4668,Nanette Stein,I don't usually give reviews unless I'm passionate about a product - good or bad.,"I just received this item today and I couldn't be more pleased. It came beautifully packaged in a stiff cardboard ""book"" type box sealed with a label. When you open it there is a quality foam border all around the glass. The glass itself was inside a nice plastic sleeve inside of a soft foam envelope. The instructions, a nice company card with instructions on one side for if you are happy with the product how to share and leave a review, and if you are not happy on the other side a promise to make it right with customer service contact details, the application tools and stickers all inside of a nice unmarked kraft brown envelope. I'm not big on a lot of useless packaging but you can easily convert the box into something you could use again and definitely use the envelope again instead of them ending up in a landfill. As for the product itself...beautiful. You are given all the tools you need to apply this to your device. There is even a YouTube prompt on the instruction booklet so you can watch it live before you try. I had no problems at all getting this onto my iPad Pro. I even put it on crooked the first time and was able to slowly and carefully lift it back off and reapply it. Then, I did have a couple of air bubbles (the second time I applied it) and was able to easily lift each corner until the air bubbles were accessible and lay the glass back down perfectly. The one thing I think would have made it easier and might have kept me from having to do a second application is the the tab on the protective cover on the sticky side of the glass could have been on the ""bottom"" (where the home button is) instead of the top so that I could have lined that part up right away instead of last. The great thing is that the home button hole is the only hole to line up. This glass fits edge to edge and is beveled all the way around. Even the good one I have on my phone leaves a 1/8 - 1/4 inch gap all the way around. This glass is a great companion to the Bluetooth keyboard iPad case I also bought from an equally fabulous company. This company really put a lot of thought into all of their systems from packaging to product to customer service. That deserves a reward. Buy from them...you won't regret it.",1

If it had installed well, it looks like it would have been a great product.  I am sure it was operator error, as with over 7,000 reviews it averages better than 4 stars, but for me this was a waste of money.",0
1578434659-4461,Brian Lev,"Not Perfect but Packaged Well, Excellent Installation Kit, Excellent Customer Service","UPDATE:  I've added 2 stars to my original review. A few days after I posted a 3-star review complaining about an apparent quality control issue (particulate matter stuck to underside of the protector *inside* the protective sheet), I received a direct email from a company representative apologizing for the problem and offering a free replacement. I was very busy & didn't respond to the email at first, so I received a 2nd email with the same offer a couple of days later. I emailed back, verified my shipping address, and a few days later a new package was on my front porch. I waited overnight for it to warm up to room temperature, removed the defective protector from the iPad, and installed the new protector after very, VERY carefully inspecting it and using the installation kit to clean the iPad's screen. There were no adhesion problems, very few bubbles (all of which were easily cleared in a matter of moments), and only one tiny imperfection that is literally invisible without a magnifying glass and a careful search. I am very pleased with the replacement product and happily shocked at the exemplary customer service. (To repeat, the company contacted me with an apology & no-strings-attached replacement before I had the chance to contact them.) As of now, I'll definitely buy from them again as needed in the future.

One quick note: As mentioned in my original review, there are stick-on tabs to create a ""hinge"" to help position the screen protector prior to installation. This time around I did not use them and found it easier to carefully position the screen protector the old-fashioned way. If you buy this product I recommend practice fitting the protector (BEFORE removing the film covering the adhesive!) with the hinges so you can tell if it would be easier for you to place it correctly with or without them -- I'm sure the choice will vary among buyers.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've used tempered glass screen protectors on a variety of devices, and the reviews of this one led to high expectations. I was amazed at how well-packaged it is: a semi-rigid heavy cardboard ""book"" style folder, with a separate ""installation kit"" inside along with the screen protector itself in a protective sleeve and an internal frame keeping everything in place & protected.

Unlike my experience with several other similar (smaller) protectors of other brands, the installation kit was complete and -- hooray! -- the ""wet"" wipe was actually wet. (Be careful opening the installation kit; I accidentally tore off a small part of the instruction booklet.) The first thing I noticed was more complete/complex instructions than I'd expected, along with a note saying I should view an instructional video on YouTube. The video came up right where it was supposed to be, but I immediately noticed that it skipped over 1 step in the printed directions (use the dry wipe after the wet wipe but before the microfiber cloth), and did not show or mention the stiff card (size of a credit card) intended to help move bubbles out from under the screen protector as the final installation step.

One very helpful feature of the installation kit was ""hinge"" stickers that let you pre-position the protector and then swing it out of the way to thoroughly clean the iPad screen, then just swing it back into place for installation already in the correct position... at least in theory. I still had to be very careful positioning the protector because the stickers still allow a bit more side-to-side wiggle than is perhaps absolutely necessary. It was when the protector was in place and beginning to adhere to the iPad screen when things went a bit sour.

Before using the installation kit, I had buffed the iPad with a clean microfiber cloth until it shined. I then used the installation kit's wet wipe, making sure to cover every tiny bit of the surface, followed by careful wiping with the kit's dry wipe. I then buffed the iPad with the microfiber cloth from the installation kit, followed by the included ""dust absorber"" (a big sticker you lightly tap all over the screen to pull off any dust particles that somehow were missed in all the preceding steps). At every step, I carefully inspected the iPad for dust, fingerprints, and any other kind of marking, checking it at multiple angles in direct & indirect lighting. (I can be a little obsessive when it comes to screen protectors.) I checked the screen protector one more time at different angles, and saw a few little spots I decided were probably dirt on the protective film. I then peeled the protective film off the back of the screen protector, swung it down onto the iPad, and began pressing out a few bubbles...

...only to find 7-8 bits of kind of particulate matter causing permanent bubbles scattered across the screen (not to mention the entire upper left 1/8 of the screen protector not sticking nearly as well as the rest of it). I peeled the protector back, did some more cleaning, reapplied the protector, and had the same particles in the same spots. I then very gently used the ""dust absorber"" directly on the sticky side of the screen protector and reapplied it for a second time, and was rewarded with just a few small bubbles I was able to manipulate out.

As of now, the upper left 1/8 of the screen protector seems to be sitting on the iPad screen and not actually adhering to it (that's 1 star off), and I'm a bit annoyed at how I had to clean particulate matter off the supposedly clean & protected *sticky* side of the screen protector (that's the 2nd star off). For the moment it seems to be staying in place & remaining clean, but I'll have to think twice about another of the same brand in the future.",1

Followed the instructions for installation, but after installed, I’ve noticed some fairly big bubbles, between the glass and screen, and wasn’t been able to remove them.  E-mailed sparin, and in about 24 hours, a rep named Lily was very helpful in directly me to a website, that give specific instructions on how to remove the bubbles.  The info did work, and it removed around 75% of the bubbles on the screen.  But I cracked the glass removing the bubbles on my second attempt at fixing it.  I informed Lily of this, and she sent me a replacement screen free of charge and delivery.  Overall, even though the installation of the product, can be a little tricky, based on the original directions.  The customer service and follow up from Sparin was excellent, and I wouldn’t hesitate to purchase products, from a company showing this much integrity with their customers complaints.  I’m really quite pleased with the way the situation was resolved to my satisfaction!",1

1578434754-4812,Amazon Customer,Great product but installation process needs work,"Satisfied with product but have suggestions for a better consumer experience.  First, the pros........great packaging and great product.  Screen protector is light weight and does not change the sensitivity of the screen or the clarity.  Apple Pencil still works great.  Would recommend to friends as an excellent price.  However, the cons...........as others have said, the guide stickers don't work as expected which is frustrating.  The concept of using the guide stickers as ""hinges"" and a ""handle"" is great.......if it worked.  However, the stickers don't hold.  You end up having to reposition the screen using your hands while trying to keep your fingerprints off the underneath side of the screen.  It would be better to not offer the guide stickers if they are not going to work.  In my case, I thought they were working when they came loose and the screen slipped sticking off center.  I was able to pull the screen up and successfully reposition.  I was also able to work out all but 2 small air bubbles but hope they will disappear within 48 hours as instructions indicated.  I would make the reference to ""SPARIN Michael"" on YouTube much more prominent as that installation video is very helpful; much more so than the written instructions which are a little weak.  Of course, it won't matter where you get instruction if the guide stickers aren't fixed.  So, bottom line, gave 4 stars as I think the product is great but the installation process needs some work.",1

1578435646-8102,D. Bibee,Great Screen Protector,"Wonderful protector. I haven't given it the test of time yet, but even in application, this protector was superior to others I had tried for my phone. This is the first protector I had purchased for an iPad and thought it was going to be a major pain because of the size difference. The guiding stickers were very helpful, and the wet and dry wipes were appreciated. I did end up with a tiny spot in the middle that had some air (probably from a speck that flew in), but it wasn't large enough to worry about lifting up any corners to try again. Everything adhered well, and I love the feel of the protector- probably more than the actual iPad screen. Very glassy and smooth.

Packaging was wonderful as well. Arrived in a padded enclosure with all ""accessories"" in an envelope. Provided this protector holds up, I will definitely purchase again.",1

First off, the installation tutorial felt cumbersome. I didn't mind but my friend kind of chuckled at all the steps. The real problem is the application of the screen.
I did all the step and there were still bubbles and I did try to get rid of them but they would not go. I went to reapply the screen (take the screen protector off and do  the steps over again).. still there were bubbles; even after I tried to get rid of them (mostly from the middle of the screen). The picture is from my 30th try and by then, I sort of gave up.
Just be wary of this product if you try it.",0

It was my first time using the guides for installation and made aligning the screen protector super easy.

As far as installment, it was easy for the most part, I like that it comes with both a wet and dry cloth to clean the screen and even a dust remover (sticker), although I still managed to get a piece of dust even though I followed the steps. The Guide stickers did not help me at all, I put all three of them on the side of the glass as directed but the glass slid off the iPad and I had to remove the stickers to re-align the glass to the iPad, so unnecessary steps were included. The soft flexible card to remove the air bubbles was so small that I didn't see it until after i had pushed most of the bubbles out by hand.

I am so glad I took a chance and ordered this!! I watched the YouTube video and within less than 5 minutes I had my iPad looking like a professional did it.  I have NO bubbles or lifting in any corners.  I was very careful to wash my hands, lift sleeves and not attract lint around me while applying.  I also did not touch any area that adheres to the screen. I ordered a second one immediately for our other iPad. This company just saved me $70!!!! Product is of great quality, Thank you",1

It was all messed up by then and I ended up just trashing the thing.  I’ve done plenty of these before. The hinge gimmick looked like it would make things easier but it did not. I should have done without the guides. Would have been much easier.  I’ll stick with the ones I know work well even though a couple dollars more. The reviews on this led me astray this time.

The application process is ridiculous. I have one from a local retailer that’s perfect and I assumed this would be just as good since it’s a well known brand. Will be heading to the store tomorrow.",1

1578435263-6729,Watch Less TV and Read More,FIVE stars for product and FIVE stars for my wife helping me apply it,"An Amazon rating of a product should include consideration of the product itself and its ease of application or installation when designed to be applied or installed by the consumer. Thus I give FIVE stars for the product and ONE star for ease of application of the product by this user. (Blame me the user.) The application was not as smooth as depicted in the Sparin A02 and Sparin A04 videos on YouTube--videos recommended for viewing by Sparin. I bought two protectors: one for my wife's iPad Pro 9.7 and one for my iPad Pro 9.7. My first attempt at applying the protector on my wife's Pro was a disaster. Trying to align it took long enough for some dust critters to adhere to the adhesive side of the protector. The bubbles won out so I had to scrap that one and try again using the protector intended for my Pro. (Blame me the user.) The second attempt of applying the protector to my wife's Pro was easier; however, while removing and reapplying the protector to deal with air bubbles, one dust critter was able to sneak in and adhere to the adhesive side of the protector, and one corner--the corner I used to remove and reapply the protector--will not adhere completely to the Pro's screen. (Blame me the user.) Overall result: Two 9.7 iPad Pros; only one has a screen protector that is not completely adhering to the screen and has a resident dust critter living between the protector and the Pro's screen. (Blame me the user.) I'm sure this is an exceptional product, but in my hands, the overall result was not so good. I'll give it a few days and try to talk myself into buying two more of this same product hoping that I learned something from my initial experience. Please don't let this review deter you from trying this product; the multiple five-star reviews is what drew me to this product in the first place. Thank you.

UPDATE: I am upgrading this to FOUR stars because Kathy of the Sparin Customer Service Team is sending me two more screen protectors! Stay tuned; this may yet earn FIVE stars overall just for customer service alone even if I mess up again!

UPDATE: I did receive the two additional screen protectors as Kathy promised! This time, I had my wife apply both screen protectors and the results were a whole lot better than when I tried to do it. FIVE stars for the product and FIVE stars for my wife for her help in applying the screen protectors. Thank you Kathy for standing behind your product! Thank you my dear wife for your help!",1

Luckily, I caught it before it went wrong, so it’s straight for the most part, but there’s a little air bubble that won’t come out even with the bubble remover card and a little fingerprint.

I had to look for one that would work for me especially when it comes to smudges. I use my iPad a lot in the kitchen, so you can only imagine! I ordered this SPARIN Tempered Glass Screen protector. I read the instructions on the small booklet and the direction to watch SPARIN A09 video on YouTube. That helped simplify things! However, I missed the placement of the iPad (which direction the home button was supposed to be facing before installing! When all was done, I didn’t have a home button! Of course it was there but covered with the screen protector! Went back to see if I read it wrong which iPad it works for and truly it works for my iPad Air 9.7”. The lights came on that watching the video, I didn’t pay attention to how the iPad was laid down and what was facing where! I took the risk of using the little card scrapper (comes in the installation package) to gently tip one corner and the carefully grab the protector without touching the inside (that touches the screen), then after peeling it off, holding by the edges turn it around to where the opening for the home button is directly centered over my home button and then gently place it and even it out! Didn’t need to reclean the screen, not even touch it. After the screen protector laid squarely on the iPad, I then used the same card and the wipe cloth provided to squish out the air bubbles. I ended up with a perfect, very responsive screen and found the home button too! Should you mess up as I did, wait till the disappointment wears off to redo it!",1

1578434670-4501,Ryan Leslie,"Pretty package, substandard product","We had previously had this brand on an iPad and reordered on accident.  The first protector shattered from a short fall, with an excellent case protecting the device. I wanted a different brand but wasn’t clear about that before the order was made.

Both items were terrible to put on. The packaging, while impressive, worsens the situation. It causes increased static. If you use the ridiculous guide stickers, keep this is in mind. Not only will they allow shifting that will require lifting and secondary attempts, they increase the time for particles to build up. It’s better to just eyeball and adjust, which you won’t do if you just flop it over with the stickers.

The static draws everything to the adhesive side immediately. And the glass is fragile. It will crack during installation if you aren’t careful during adjustments. Or if you discover particles underneath...

The cleaning wipe is also absurd. Both times it created a film on a pre-cleaned surface. That requires extra time wiping after use.

The plastic tab for smoothing bubbles is a joke. Don’t waste time using it.

Just buy something else.",0

The cut out for the home button was not ""on center"". It was slightly offset from the actual home button. I may be picky by it seems a simple fix would be making the hole a little bigger. It is unpleasant to feel the edge of the cut out every time you touch the home button. Also, I wasn't expecting the entire top of the screen protector would be cut short to accommodate the face camera hole. Seems a simple fix to just cut out around the hole so the screen protector covers more of the top of the screen. As it is the screen protector stops about 1/2"" from the top of the iPad. I will be returning this.
UPDATE: in my initial review I critiqued the size of the screen not covering the entire screen. While in function this may be true it makes little difference in the long run. When I finally installed it the process was simple. Not sure why folks are complaining about bubbles. For me there were none. I am supposing the negative reviews have more to do with user error than the product itself. This product is going to preserve the resale value of my iPad 100 times over. Very happy.",1

I am using the screen protector with Targus Versavu Rotating 9.7 inch case for iPad (model THZ63403GL-52).  Both fit PERFECTLY and have a very high quality feel.  When scrolling, the finger glides over the protector in the same way it would if it were not there.

The installation was a breeze and I do not quite understand those who complain the installation is difficult. SPARIN provided a Youtube video, however, I would suggest the following approach that is slightly different.

1. Instead of hinging the screen on the short side of the iPad, hinge it on the long side using all three stickers that are provided.
2. Once you finally peel off the film and lay the screen carefully down on the iPad, DO NOT swipe your finger across the iPad, as shown in the video. That will very likely create bubbles, just like it did in the video. Instead, just put your index finger in the center of the screen and watch the magic do its work.

I am very happy with this purchase.",1

The only complaint I have is that it added some glare to the screen, but my iPad Pro 9.7 inch screen was designed to have no glare, so some additional glare was to be expected anyways. Have been using for a few months now to take notes at school with my Apple Pencil, and I have not noticed any scratches or imperfections. Would recommend.",1

1578434971-5631,faa440,Far Exceeded Expectations,"Great protective screen at an unbelievable price.  The screen is made of a hard, exceptionally clear material, not the cheaper flimsy plastic type.  The packaging and presentation of the product is also of the utmost quality and truly a leap ahead of any others including a certain $54 similar protector I recently purchased from BB.  Even the included screen application tools are more than what I've ever before seen. Included is a wet cloth and a dry cloth; a microfiber cloth; a special, tacky backed dust collector (which I didn't need); a card to smooth out any bubbles (again wasn't needed); and finally, three adhesive strips that you use to create a hinge when first prepositioning the cover.  The idea here is to align the cover over the iPad, and then attach these strips as hinges.  From there, you would then hinge back the sheet, clean the iPad screen, remove the thin film protecting the screen's adhesive,and finally hinge the protective cover back into perfect alignment over the iPad screen.  Though I thought this was a great idea, the plastic strips easily became detached from the sheet at the critical moment I was making the final application of the screen to the iPad. No problem here as I just reverted to the conventional method of hand positioning.  The amazing part is what happens once you've made the final alignment and than back away.  Over the next 10 seconds, you watch as a wave of adhesive flows up & down and left & right until a perfect, bubble & dust free interface is formed. I smoothed the surface out anyway, even though there were no dust specs or bubble imperfections to address.  I can't speak to any issues I may have encountered had I improperly positioned the protector and than had to peel back and reapply because I was lucky enough to correctly position the first time. Of all the screen protectors I've applied over the years, this was the easiest and most trouble free.  I highly recommend.",1

I got it applied without a single bubble.  There was no waiting for bubbles to disappear within 24 to 48 hours.  I didn't have any to wait for!  I highly recommend this brand.  I watched videos first and ultimately decided to apply without using the stickers that at came as an option.  The dust catcher was key.  I would make sure you use it.  Great product and brand.,1

It comes with stickers that are supposed to help with guiding your placement. On one side of the iPad of your choosing, the stickers act as a door hinge to keep your placement. Didn't work great they kept unsticking. Because of the size of the protector, a tray for guiding or a suction cup to hover your protector over the devisee to place it properly would have been most helpful. After failed attempts and small fibers and dust creeping under my protector when adjusting it started to accumulate, I just said forget it. Will probably buy a BodyGuardz screen protector that comes with a tray for placement, the glass itself was good.",0

Make sure you watch the YouTube instructional videos (search ""SPARIN MICHAEL"") or else you will most likely run into problems. Some of the air bubbles wouldn't come out so I carefully removed it and reinstalled it without a problem.
One of the biggest cons about the iPad screen is how many fingerprints it collects, but this screen protector takes care of that! The only downside to the screen protector is that you lose the anti-glare effect. It bothered me at first, but I got over it. Small price to pay for peace of mind and no finger prints.",1

1578434664-4481,N. Grimm,Adhesive side arrived dusty/fuzzy (UPDATED review),"Ordered this to go with my son's new iPad for Christmas. Having a 5 year old...screen protector is a must. I usually go with a diff brand but having the Holiday time crunch and after reading reviews, I went with this product. The protector states its glass, but mine is plastic. Christmas is a few days away so I thought to install anyways. Wasnt to happy to find the adhesive side was already smattered w a fuzzy type particulate under the protective film (sandwiched between screen protector and plastic film). I used the ""dust absorber"" sticker gently to get as much off as possible and applied ""glass"" protector. Corners wont adhere and have bubbles. Will deal with it through Christmas and then buy a more trusted brand immediately after. Wouldnt reccomend this screen protector.
EDIT: Seller reached out to us and offered a replacement screen free of charge.

1578434687-4570,Alicia Thompson,Very Disappointed,"I've purchased glass protective cases before and if our ipad's dropped they were saved.  That's happened to us maybe unfortunately twice since owning iPads. The glass case is what broke on us, not the actual iPad which is the purpose of these cases.  Recently my son dropped our iPad and the screen completely shattered.  At first I thought it wasn't a big deal, it was just the protector screen, we could peel it off and the iPad should be fine right? That's what happened in the past... well, Not this time.  Our iPad was completely shattered and the screen was not tempered glass as it said it was.  It was plastic.  It peeled right off, and went right back on over the shattered glass.  When the iPad fell typically the tempered glass case is what breaks.  It shouldn't be able to peel off and go back on.  It should be broken and unusable once taken off. Because it's happened in the past and our iPad was perfectly fine, but the protector case was cracked.  The fact that I thought our iPad was protected this entire time, and now my iPad is shattered because we really had a plastic case on it and not glass is what really upsets me. We have never had our iPad shatter using a tempered glass protector screen.  So this clearly is not tempered glass. Next time I will buy my screen at the store and make sure it is a real protector screen.",0

It was extremely user friendly and the screen is perfect.  I don't really think most people would even need the video but I wanted to make sure I didn't have any bubbles in the screen.

- I love that it came with a complete kit of stuff to make the application easy (instructions (you would be amazed how many don't ship with them, application wet cleaning cloth, application dry cleaning cloth, a dust lifter (in case there are small particles during application), guide stickers (so that it helps you ""hinge"" the glass for application (and trust me, use all 3 for the pro - better to be safe than sorry), and a regular cleaning cloth for you to use to wipe of finger prints and such.
- Application was a breeze! I waited until I got the screen protector before I even opened up iPad box. So no finger prints, virtually no dust particles.
- I followed the hinge, peel, and press from the center out method and got a flawless application without any junk under the glass.

- I COULDN'T BE ANY HAPPIER!!

*just a side note for those that it matters to - there is only one (1) hole in the protector and that's for the home button. There is no hole for the forward facing camera, but quite honestly, there doesn't need to be. it works even better, because there is one less hole for dust to collect in.",1

1578434726-4720,Ciscokid,Great Customer Support,"I seldom review the products I purchase on Amazon. Yet, I was so impressed with the products and support from SPARIN that I feel compelled to provide them with some positive feedback.
First of all, the SPARIN Screen Protectors are everything they advertise them to be. They work well. They protect the investment you have in your expensive hand-held electronics and they have no adverse effects upon the operation of these devices or their accessories. In some ways they actually improve the functionality (i.e. they help to reduce glare). These Screen Protectors allow the displays to remain scratch free and easy to clean.
I have installed several of these on phones and one on a smaller tablet. Using the instructions included in the package along with those found on YouTube all of my earlier installations were flawless. However, the larger the device the more challenging the installation can become.
I recommend that you review all of the SPARIN YouTube videos before you begin the process. One of the videos demonstrates an alternate installation that does not use the provided Guide Stickers. You may find it easier to maintain accurate alignment of larger Screen Protectors using that method. Also make sure you are in an absolutely dust free environment prior to performing the install.
I did encounter some difficulties getting things to work correctly when I installed a Screen Protector on my larger iPad 9.7"" (2017). It developed a persistent bubble adjacent to the “Home” button that I could not remove. I contacted SPARIN and received the best customer support I have ever witnessed. The SPARIN Customer Service Team personally responded to my email questions within hours. They were responsive, supportive and extremely helpful throughout the entire resolution process.
SPARIN has a quality product and provides outstanding customer support if you come upon a problem. This is what you expect when you make a purchase. It is too bad that other companies don’t follow SPARIN’s lead and make sure their customers get what they paid for.",1

1578434806-5014,David C. Robine,Works great when you are careful,"This screen protector installed perfectly and fits perfectly.  This was my second one, and some precautions above and beyond what the directions tell you are in order.  One, install it in a humid environment to keep dust down.  Two, use all three of the supplied hinge tapes, and make sure they are secure before proceeding to remove the backing from the screen protector.  Press down on the strips to make sure they adhere to the front of the screen protector and the body of the iPad.  I live in New Mexico, where it is very dry and dusty.  With the first one, I followed the directions carefully, but the strain of removing the backing pulled the hinges off and the protector went on crooked!  When I lifted it off (and trying to be very careful) to reposition it, a couple of specks of dust got under it, ruining it for me.  I told Sparin about it, and they insisted on sending me a second one.  This time, I put it on in the bathroom with the shower running to keep dust down, and it worked perfectly and is hard to tell it's even there. So, with being very careful, and reducing your chances for dust, it's actually pretty easy.  Something about the adhesive makes it go on very smoothly and you hardly have to do much to remove any last bubbles.  I highly recommend it!  Sparin has excellent customer service as well.",1

We just removed the protector (it came off easily despite having many cracks) and found that the screen underneath was completely undamaged.

This company's packaging of their product protects it well for shipping. It is easy to open. The instructions are easy to follow. The wet wipe removed 2 weeks of smudges from my iPad very quickly and I was ready to place the screen protector. The way the instructions suggested you align the protector beforehand made placing the easiest that I have ever done. It aligned perfectly and by the time I was done checking the four edges it was attached to the iPad screen with one 1/4"" air pocket in corner. I pressed on it; it disappeared.

Shipping: Fast
Packaging: Excellent
Instructions: Excellent
Screen Protector: Works fine with Apple Pen, fits edge to edge as I think it should (not shorted like the one on my iPhone), I'll try to report back as to the durability.

The underside of the screen was an absolute dust magnet so even once I had everything clean - in the time it took to flip the glass over onto the front of the iPad the protection sheet had picked up several very small pieces of lint and now they cannot be cleared off.

1578435824-8753,Melissa,Comes with two packs of glass and cleaning accessories!,"I purchased this tempered glass for my new iPad Pro 9.7 inch.

PROS:
-Came with TWO sets of glass
-Allows for pressure sensitivity and palm sensitivity with Apple Pencil
-Comes with wipes, cloth, and alignment paper to make sure you get it on correctly

CONS:
-Difficult to install but would be much harder without all the added accessories this pack includes
-First glass cracked when trying to put it on - second glass went on perfectly

All in all this product is cheap but comes with everything necessary for you to install yourself. Although the first glass cracked before I got it on the iPad the second piece of glass is working great. It makes me feel better knowing if I dropped my iPad the glass protector would crack before my screen cracked. I've very pleased with this purchase and would recommend for anyone with an iPad Pro.

1578435721-8398,bmoag,You can read glowing reviews but real experience differs,"I seriously doubt that most people will be able to apply this screen to their iPad without residual bubble formations. I have to presume that the bubbles, in different areas of the screen, represent imperfections in the flatness of the ipad screen, the screen protector or defects in the glue on the protector. The bubble are unmovable and recur as soon as pressure is released. They do not dissipate or move after hours of observation--they may be getting bigger. Doubtless the manufacturer will blame the user (did not let ipad screen dry before applying, etc) but I believe that whether this will work for you is a less than 50-50 proposition. Sadly my experience is that this is one of the legions of inexpensive, well reviewed but actually useless items on Amazon. I used to just swallow the cost but I am tired of buying reasonably priced crud that simply does not work so Amazon (hopefully the vendor) can pay more for shipping this thing back and forth than it is worth. The product is nicely packaged and not difficult to align with the screen but I would rather have something that works as advertised.",0
1578434973-5646,Alex-Anna,Exactly what I expected,"It's great but definitely isn't smudge-proof or anti-glare. After cracking my iPad screen, I needed this to be less of a protector and more of a ""smoother."" I use my iPad for sketching, so the cracks were a problem. This protector did exactly what I needed! Unfortunately, the cracks created tiny peaks and valleys, so the protector has lots of bubbles under it. I'd recommend getting it BEFORE you crack your screen. ;)",1

1578434667-4497,Chuck J.,Good luck.,"If you can manage to install this screen protector without any dust or foreign debris under it, it will probably do a great job.  However, that's the problem.

Installation involves positioning the protector on the screen, and using stickers to create a sort of temporary hinge.  Once you've done that, there is a provided wet wipe to clean the screen, and a microfiber cloth to remove excess cleaner and fingerprints.  Next, the protective film must be removed from the glass, and here is where the problem lies.

Unless you have an ISO-9001 certified clean room at your disposal, I'm not sure how you can install this screen protector without getting any dust under it.  Removing the protective film creates such a buildup of static electricity that I could feel it, hear it, and even smell it.  It attracted dust out of the air, and by the time I got the glass onto my device and pressed down, the dust was sealed in.  It might not have been so bad, except that it creates a bubble around it where the glass is not in contact with the device, and it's very obvious, even for a small piece of dirt.

I removed the glass from the device, and attempted to remove the offending debris, but only succeeded in making the problem worse.  It quickly became apparent that I was not going to be able to use this screen protector.  I was very hopeful for a product that got so many positive reviews, but I am now disappointed.

Two stars, because as I said, if you can manage to get it installed without dust, it probably works just fine.  Good luck.

UPDATE: I was contacted by Sparin regarding my review above, and they offered to provide me with a free replacement.  We had a bit of email difficulty, but kudos for excellent customer service.  I received the replacement today, and I just happened to have a room in my house where I had just remodeled, so it was clean, clean, clean.  I applied the screen protector there, using the no stickers method (search YouTube for ""SPARIN A02""), which I would highly recommend.  This time, I got the screen protector installed on my iPad with no dust and only minor bubbles, which I was able to work out.  As I predicted above, once the screen protector is applied with no dust, dirt, or bubbles under it, it looks fine.  It feels smooth to the touch, as you'd expect for glass, and it doesn't add much in the way of thickness.  My case still fit around my iPad with no issues.  It seems to be pretty scratch resistant.  As for shattering, only time will tell (or hopefully, it won't!).

I'm updating my rating from 2 stars to 4, based on the customer service, and the apparent quality of the product (once you get it installed properly).",1

With reference to using the tempered glass with the Apple pencil, it works seamlessly.  No issues with connectivity.  I can't say the same about the keyboard but, I digress. I called to find out how much it would cost to fix the iPad LCD and without apple care or warranty, it's a $379.00 fix.  Get the glass. :/",1

It has clear cut instructions on how to install, and includes guide stickers (to use as hinges), microfiber cloth, wet wipes, and even a link to a video that shows you how to do it. I did experience some difficulty getting the glass on straight as the hinge stickers pull it this way and that. Also, it was a little difficult to discern which side was the adhesive side, so just keep in mind the red sticker in the corner goes on the right side lol. Don't end up like me and get it perfectly aligned only to find out you have the wrong side down..  And after all of that, I did end up having huuuuge bubbles on the right side of my screen opposite of the hinges. However, I was able to use a credit card carefully to lift the corners of the glass and release them. In the end of the day, this is a quality product and the little bit of time spent on installation is well worth the cost.",1

1578435328-6959,S. Benjamin,It's ok for the price,"It is highly reflective so you are losing some of the anti-glare features of the iPad Pro.  It's not a huge deal, but it's worth knowing.

The included guide stickers are a clever idea to make a hinge so the protector is installed correctly, however they are not sticky enough at all! Following the instructions, I made the hinge and took off the protective plastic from the adhesive backing - and the second I tried to put the protector on the guide stickers came off and I was left with a bunch of huge bubbles on the screen I can't get rid of. You don't really notice them while it's on unless it's at the right angle, so it's ok I guess.

They really should improve the stickers.

It comes with a unique install plan that has you create a hinge. I added my own addition which was a 3rd tab on the opposite side of the hinge to swing the screen protector.

The only “con” was the cut of the material. I wish it had been cut to fit the thumb hole and the camera like my last screen protector. This one has a hole for the thumb but it is cut just below the camera instead of above it with a hole for the camera.",1

I suspect this is how they have received so many stars - pester the daylights out of a buyer until they give you a good review.

Comes w/o any directions for installation. No problem. I had read other posts before buying so went online and watched a video for installation. Placed on a brand new iPad. Went on flawlessly. Piece of cake. A few small bubbles but was able to squeegee them out easily. Then the problems started. The film had cracked in several locations. And the cracks started growing - literally. If this product cracks when installing, how can it possibly protect the screen and remain undamaged? Not possible. A total waste of money. I will contact Amazon and hope for a refund.",0

1578435339-6995,JustMe,5-star product,"Easy installation (no fighting bubbles or waiting for them to ""disappear""), instructions are very clear.  The guide tabs are a great idea during installation, although for me it was easier to just line it up myself.  The great thing about the tempered glass protectors is that they feel as smooth as the device's original screen.  If a major event cracks this screen, it's affordable enough to replace.  This protector doesn't just lift off, but if needed removal is a surprisingly easy if you work slowly.  I personally love the smooth feel of glass protectors, and I also love not having to do much smoothing out of bubbles during install.

Another great feature about this brand is the packaging.  The glass itself is in a thin foam wrapper, in a very sturdy box with instructions on install and all tools needed for the process, including wipes to clean the device screen and a lint free cloth to wipe it down.  The cloth is like what you use on glasses, and it can be used for that after installation.

UPDATE the Sparin customer service team is awesome. They contacted me immediately and offered several options (i.e. send a new screen protector at no charge or issue a refund) to resolve my issue.

1578434869-5252,Olivia Gordon,Super easy to install,"I just got this screen protector for my iPad 5th generation. It came with a lot of tools for application, but once I found the instructions, it was super easy to install. I've had a lot of trouble in the past with applying screen protectors. I usually get bubbles, or I miss dust that will end up getting trapped under the screen. The cleaning tools were very effective in getting previous smudges and dust from the screen. I found the guide stickers to be a great idea to create the hinge so the screen protector stays lined up correctly. It went on really smoothly, with only a couple bubbles that I was able to get out easily. I've always loved glass screen protectors. They feel sturdy and are fairly scratch resistant. Overall, great purchase!",1

1578434804-5010,Daniel Lequerica,Wow! This is really high quality and for such a cheap price. Very good!,"Just 3 days ago I went to Best Buy looking for a Screen protector that was compatible with my iPad Pro and Apple Pencil and I was in disbelief when the cheapest protector I could find was 50 bucks… Needless to say I nope'd out of there and when I got back home browsed through Amazon for a cheaper option.

This was the first result and so I went with it. I took my time cleaning the screen with the tools provided with the package and once installed I took an extra 6 to 8 minutes removing all the bubbles. Now it doesn't even look like there's a protector there to  begin with and it works 100% fine with the Apple Pencil, allowing me to continue working on my artwork with ProCreate.

Great quality, guys, thank you so much for creating such an affordable and solid alternative to the Brand Name stuff out there!!!",1
1578434707-4647,Thinkman,When will someone come up with one that REALLY works!,"I gave this screen protector a higher mark than it likely deserved, only because it was slightly less of a hassle to apply than others I've used. The hinges are a joke! The dust spotter leaves marks requiring cleaning the screen, so that's a big F-. I finally was able to apply it manually after the 3rd try, and still was unable to get all of the bubbles out. The best part of this protector is that it is the most smudge proof of any I've used in the past, so that's a big A+.",0

The case not only looks good, but it also has protected my iPad during multiple incidents where it was dropped.  I would have given this case five stars, but my stylus pen that it came with completely stopped working within 3 days.  I was very disappointed because I had really liked the pen with the case.",1

This makes me very confident in the seller and would definitely recommend purchasing from them. Quick and helpful if there's any problems.

Now on to the screen protector...After it has been applied, it doesn't t affect the quality of the screen, nor does it affect touch sensitivity which would be a great concern of mine.  I use the Apple Pencil and it works great on it.  I notice NO difference between when I didn't have the protector on it or after it had been applied.

It appears to be made of high quality materials and I've had no problems when putting it on my two other iPhone 6s Plus devices I have.

Thank you for your great support!!",1

I tried to take it off and clean the screen like the company recommended but now it’s full of bubbles and looks even worse than before.

So I watched the YouTube instructions a few times. Then I began the installation, with the video instructions, pausing them after each step. It worked!",1
1578434700-4619,StevenJens,Seamlessly works! Comes with cleaning products before application. iPad looks great as ever.,"Great product! The tempered glass covers the entire front of the iPad, but it does not look intrusive. In fact, if it's applied correctly, the protective cover seamlessly integrates well with the product.

I love how the product comes with a wet wipe, dry wipe, microfiber cloth and a dust remover. Using them in that order ensures that your original screen is clean, and the screen protector will look 100% transparent after application.

The product came with some ""GuideStickers"" to help you make a hinge and apply the protective screen easier. I found this not to be very helpful as the stickers kept coming off. I ended up grabbing the screen on its side, without touching the side that contacts with the iPad screen, and applied it manually.

Some negative reviews claim that they have unremovable bubbles after applying the cover. I think this is careless application on their part. If you are careful, you can ensure that there are no bubbles after application. The best way to prevent any potential bubbles is to make sure that the protective screen is placed starting from one edge and finishing of to another edge. I found that bending the protective screen ensured this edge-to-edge placement. In essence, you want to displace all of the air so that there is no gap between your iPad screen and the protective glass cover.

See the attached picture to see how it looks if done properly! The protective screen certainly looks like it's meant to be part of the iPad and I don't see any visual change in terms of viewing quality.",1

Most covers are a thin film that does not protect the case; however, this cover is very thick tempered glass.  Sparin  included a cleaning wipe & several cleaning ""tapes"" that did an excellent job removing dust particles when covering the iPad. It took several attempts to place the glass exactly right without any small dust particles but the thickness of the glass made it extremely easy.  Due to the fact that there is NO sticky stuff on the glass to deal with, placement was excellent if you make a mistake with alignment.  CAUTION: take your time DO NOT rush...remove all the dust from both mating surfaces.  This cover is most excellent and placement on the iPad was easy.",1

As per the advice of other reviewers, I allowed the screen protector 24 hours to come to room temperature before installing. I hate bubbles, so I found a clean library room and waited until the AC fan was off (didn't want anything blowing around). Pre-cleaned my screen with an old lens cloth just because I'm paranoid. The cleaning kit that came with the screen protector is appreciated, although there were two items that weren't mentioned in the instructions: one dry wipe, and a pull tab (I assumed it was to be used to position the screen, although I didn't use it and did fine). As per instrutions, I pre-positioned the screen protector, then applied the hinge stickers. I realized too late that I had placed the screen protector wrong-side up, but no worries! The hinge stickers weren't excessively sticky, and I was able to remove them without problems or damage. I re-placed the screen protector and hinge stickers, and gave placement a few practice tries as per other reviewers suggestions. I followed the cleaning instructions, and if I could take just half a star off, I would: the dust wipe left a film on the screen that, had I not noticed, would have caused problems. No worries, the microfiber dust cloth took care of the film and the screen was pristine. I placed the screen protector easily, sealed it to the screen, and removed the hinge stickers. Works beautifully, and I honestly can't even tell its here except that the glare is noticeably reduced (which is why I purchased this in the first place).",1

Surprise, the install went almost perfectly and I love the quality of the tempered glass screen... so much more substantial than any other product I've used!
I do have a couple of comments about the very brief instructions.
 (1) I wish they'd illustrated specifically which side of the screen/protective film should face up when aligning it on your device prior to attaching the hinge stickers. How about a ""THIS SIDE UP"" sticker?
The screen ended up not precisely aligned on the top right side of my iPad Pro 9.7"" but this is probably my own fault
(2) there were no instructions on how to handle bubbles...I guess they didn't expect you to have any?
(3) perhaps they should have mentioned to watch the online video first
Notes:
- I had very few bubbles. They were easily handled. In fact, the tempered screen almost seemed to lay itself down!
- no problem with the hinge stickers...fit firmly and easy to remove
- fabulously clear screen
- no problem using iPencil with tempered screen

It's why the big box stores charge so much for the item and to install!!  But you can do it - just read instructions and watch YouTube - then watch YouTube again.  My husband watched several videos and that helped immensely.  As for doing what the product is meant to do (to make sure your actual screen doesn't smash if dropped) I don't know and hopefully will never test this feature.  But it seems just as good or better than one bought and installed on another IPad at the store (for 1/6 the price!!),1

I applied the screensaver per the instructions on my iPad Generation  6.  The screensaver is lined up properly on the iPad BUT I have 2 bubbles on the left side of the screen.  I tried massaging the screen with no help. (When I purchased my phones, the phone store put the screensavers on for me.)  I read other reviews and some said the “bubbles dissolved on the own”.  This unfortunately has not happen for me.  I did not want to take off and start over because I did not want to disrupt the integrity of the glue on the screensaver.  At this point, I will put up with the bubbles until I order a new screensaver. I don’t think it is the product but my application skills.",1

I received a follow up email from the seller asking about my purchase. I commented that I felt my Apple Smart Keyboard doesn’t close as tightly and I was offered resolution steps or a refund.  Since I really didn’t mind, I declined both.

The included items to install the screen are a nice bonus (various types of screen wipes) and allows you to get your screen free of contaminants to ensure a perfect installation. I originally purchased a more expensive screen protector (rhymes with Lagg) but decided to give this one a chance because of the positive reviews. I'm glad I gave this protector a chance, it fit the screen nicely and provides good protection. The packaging for the protector itself is great and easily survived my mailman stuffing it in my mail box.

I had bought this product and it was very hard to get rid of the bubbles. When I attempted to get rid of the bubbles with a thick tag, it left 2 small scratches. I initially did not like it because of the installation process causing bubbles, however, the customer service contacted me and offered to send another one to replace and try the installation again. I will update once I receive the product and have someone else install it for me. I like that the company values the opinion of the customer, reaches out to them and tries to improve the product. I believe that is what makes for a very good company. Thus, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase knowing that the company listens and honors the concern of the customer. The screen protector itself is very sturdy not flimsy at all . It came securely in a thick high quality frame book. You also receive a wet and dry wipe, along with a cleaning cloth and 3 stickers. The screen protector works great with the apple pencil and doesn't cause any problems or lag. One thing to note is that the screen protector covers the front view camera of the ipad. There is no small hole there, however it doesn't cause any problems or obstruction with the picture quality as the screen protector is clear. I would recommend to give this product a try because of the amazing customer service, you have nothing to lose.

Otherwise the screen protector does it job. Apple pencil works and it's definitely worth the money, compared to other expensive tempered glas protectors. I would recommend this, minus the problem with the bubbles.",0

1578434775-4900,jpp,"Took a beating and cracked while protecting my iPad Pro 9.7, great return on investment","Installed easily onto iPad Pro 9.7 and zero issues during 2 years of use.
My iPad lives in a keyboard folio case but sometimes it falls from bed/table. Yesterday (2 years after purchase/install) the iPad fell onto the floor and I saw a crack. I prayed that the crack was in the screen protector, not the tablet's display. Not only did the screen protector prevent damage to the iPad, the cracked halves of the screen protector were held together by the adhesive backing film of the product so there was no cleanup mess.
I am happily purchasing another one of these to continue protecting my iPad display.",1
1578434697-4608,Courtney,So good i thought i had cracked my ipad screen,"Normally when you install screen protectors you can kind of tell that its there. Not this one. I actually forgot i install this knight in clear armor, even up to the point where it had cracked. I actually thought when I spotted the crack on my iPad I thought it was a screen protector holding the crack together. Eventually the crack spread across my iPad and I did some investigation and it turns out that it was a screen protector that had cracked. So be warned if the protector has been cracked itll spiderweb right across your iPad. Totally purchasing again.",1

1578434672-4511,samsamsurecan,Jealous of this screen protector,"I bought this for my mom’s iPad that she got for Christmas and also put it on for her. It was the easiest experience I’ve ever had with putting these types of things on devices. I didn’t believe it when it said it doesn’t bubble, but it’s true*! (*you have to be sure to clean the screen well, and make sure not dust particles make their way to the edges as the screen is setting in). I don’t know why other screen protectors don’t include “guidance stickers” which basically allows you to create hinges so jar way you can position the screen properly and not just hope that it falls into the correct place. The kit comes with cleaning wipes (both wet and dry), a cleaning cloth, a little card to help the protector settle on to the screen, and even a sticker to help take any remaining dust particles before you place the protector.

This was definitely the best option for the price and I’m completely satisfied with my experience. Now to see if it holds up against the normal wear and tear of use.",1

(Tape and cleaning supplies included) You theift the protector to one side and clean the iPad screen. Once clean you take off the sticker exposing the sticky side of the protector and just let it fall down into place. Then push out the bubbles which there were not many and bam perfect fit and look. Also having that protection is nice in the back of the mind just in case.

I followed their instructional video carefully:  Make hinge with stickers (to guide the sheet later).  Clean screen with the wet and dry wipes they provide.  Remove any final dust with their dust removal sticker.  Pull protective plastic off the glass sheet.  Swing glass screen protector into place and swipe it once, lengthwise across the center, with 1 finger.  Then I watched in amazement as the screen protector just sucked itself into place, eliminating all air underneath.  At first it looked like there might be a couple of bubbles near the edges but the thing just kept sucking itself tighter onto my ipad until it was perfectly sealed.  They do provide a ""push"" tool in case you need to work it yourself, but that wasn't needed.  I am amazed and delighted.",1

1578434707-4646,John M.,GREAT screen protector! Great application. Great performance.,"The applications directions were clear. The package included all the necessary wipes, dust remover sticker, and guide stickers for easy installation.  Some of the tempered glass protectors I have used for phones had guide stickers already in place on the glass. These guide stickers were separate, so you can place them exactly where it is comfortable for you. This made it very easy to apply the protector and get it aligned perfectly.
The product itself is perfect. It perfectly fit the dimensions of the iPad Pro 9.7 and the cut-out for the Home button. The tempered glass does not interfere in any way with the touchscreen sensitivity. It is just as responsive after application as it was before putting it on. It also does not interfere with sleep/wake performance of the cases I have used. It is thin, yet protective. No scratches on it and it does not smudge or leave oily streaks from my fingerprints.

1578434664-4486,Chris_1200,Sadly disappointed,"It pains me to write this review because I've often used Sparin screen protectors in the past due to their quality fit and finish. Unfortunately this one doesn't live up to their reputation.
First, I have to say that I pride myself on being able to install these protectors perfectly, with no dust or bubbles. I know it sounds like hubris, but I do it for all of my friends and family members because of the results I'm able to get. It's a limited talent, but it's what I've got.
However, I cannot get the edges and the holes to line up with this screen protector. There is a noticeable ripple and curvature to the edges. It's simply not cut correctly. It's difficult enough to get right, due to the size of the thing, but because the cutouts don't line up it's impossible to have the edges aligned with the sides and the holes centered around the sensor and camera. If it was only slightly off it would be fine, but if I center the holes one edge hangs off just enough to not stick down. I finally got it close enough but the corners and parts of the edge don't adhere. It's not in the visible area, so I wasn't concerned, but over time the gaps are spreading farther into the screen area. It's slowly peeling itself off. Picture attached.
I contacted Sparin, and while they agreed to send a replacement, their attitude was that my installation was clearly at fault. They made it clear that they did not consider this a warranty issue. They said they would, out of the goodness of their hearts, give me ONE MORE to try again. There is not one spec of dust under it, and it is lined up with the sides as perfectly as I could get it.
I will try the replacement in the hope that this was a rare factory defect, but based on the poor quality control, and the attitude of their customer service, if it doesn't work I won't buy another one from Sparin. I've deducted a star for each issue.

Update: I received a replacement and it installed correctly on the first try. The edges are straight and it sealed down with no bubbles. One small tip of a corner doesn’t seal completely, but that is perfectly acceptable with a piece this size.",0

I am taking off a star because of the air bubbles that remain. It is not such a big deal, but I think it should be easier to place this on without getting the air bubbles left behind. I tried several times to put it on and off. Maybe I have bad technique and others have had better luck with the air bubbles.

Anyway, the screen protector is easy to instal. I never use the ""hinge"" technique they tell you to use when installing it. I just lined it up using the cut-out for Home button/bottom edge and slowly lowered it onto the screen; readjusting it slightly as I lowered it. Works every time for me.

So why 4 stars? the claim that it's coated in an oligophobic layer (for smudge resistance) only lasted MAYBE half a day. But that's typical for almost all the screen protectors out there. By the next day, you could see every smudge made. Still, I'd recommend this screen protector to anyone who wants to buy one. It's cheap, easy to instal, and works with my case.",1

1578434713-4664,Amazon Customer,Completely Impressed,"I'm not one to write reviews. When I received the email from SPARIN asking me to review the product it still had not arrived due to a shipping error by Amazon. So basically the email just went unnoticed. When the product did arrive, I immediately was impressed by the packaging. A heavy weight box with a great presentation to even include an icon that read ""explosion proof."" I want to test that part. When I opened the box I again was impressed. The screen protector was surrounded by a foam rubber frame to protect it, and also encased by two protective layers of styrofoam wrap. The company enclosed all of its literature in an envelope that made me think I was getting a greeting card along with my screen protector. They even included a ""happy / not happy"" card that reiterates their desire to provide you a good product or they will do what they can to make it right.
As for the screen protector, it seems solid. It has been on my iPad for less than 24 hours, and as long as it stands up to the torture that I know I will put it through, I am beyond happy with my purchase.
For some reason if the product does give me problems, I have a feeling the company will make it right. Great job.",1

1578434670-4506,redsoxgirl807,You get only one shot,"This seems to be a pretty good screen protector, especially for the price. I read the instructions and watched the suggested YouTube instruction video. The process is simple enough. HOWEVER, I missed a small speck of dust in the corner as I was placing the protector.  I noticed it right away and lifted the corner (which is where it was, right near the edge) and used the dust absorber again. The dust is gone but now the corner won’t adhere to the glass no matter how many times I tried to smooth it out, it just lifts again. Also, the area where I lifted now appears to be scratched even though I was super careful.

I’m pretty obsessive when aligning things and making sure it’s perfect so I was annoyed that I missed a speck of dust. Other screen protectors I have used in the past are more forgiving if you have to lift and replace them.

My advise to you is to check and double check that you have removed all dust (and while I didn’t have this problem, make sure it’s aligned properly too).  This protector is unforgiving. You get one shot at getting it right.",0

1578435374-7117,Mylilturtl,Updated review.,"Followed directions in packaging exactly, as I have installed many screen protectors in the past (each one is different);  I have not had issues with any other brand previously. This one was the worst I've ever dealt with by far.  The first step is to use a moisture wipe to clean the screen, but the steps following that do not fully remove all miniscule bits of moisture and they get trapped on the screen giving your screen protector bubbles that cannot be repaired.  Very disappointed and will not order from this company again.  Also, after my package was received and after I had already installed the screen,  I received an email from manufacture with a link to some online directions.  I'm not sure if they were different, but it was too late by that point.

Update:  The company saw the original review and sent me an email asking if they could send me a replacement product.  Kudos for wonderful customer service.  New product went on much better.  Thank you.",1

I thought it had only cracked the supposedly glass screen protector. I was wrong. When I removed it today to replace I was  unpleasantly surprised that the crack was also in the screen of the Ipad itself. I'm not very happy about it. I went ahead and replaced it with this anyway. Since I had already purchased it and prepped the Ipad. I understand that things can crack a screen through a protector, for example a hammer or a brick. That is not what happened in this case. I dropped my vape mod on it from a height of approximately 7 or 8 inches. Additionally the product doesn't feel like glass. It feels like a sturdy piece of plastic.",0

Most of them were fairly competent in their function but they all share one flaw. Putting a protective layer of any kind always seems takes away from the picture. Yes, even if its just clear, plastic just doesn't reflect the same way, just doesn't look as sharp to me as the original glass. Maybe I'm crazy but thats been my experience thus far. I accept that with a full surround case or a screen protector I will be sacrificing image quality, especially as the plastic protector ages. Having said all of this, this is the single best screen protector I have ever purchased. Easy to install, comes with literally everything you need to install it, and once its in place there is absolutely zero image quality difference whatsoever, like zero, the picture seriously looks exactly as it does without it on.

1578435099-6113,Nicole,Easy to install,"Easy to install. No dust or bubbles. Crystal clear, you can’t even tell a protector is on the iPad. I didn’t need any of the guides it came with. Just peel & stick",1
1578435097-6103,R. W. Bennett,Guide stickers don't work for me. But Sparin is helping me make it right,"I bought two of the Sparin 9.7 screen protectors knowing they are tricky to install. I watched the video twice and attempted to install the first protector. I used the guide stickers as in the video to form the hinge. After I removed the protective film, the stickers forming the hinge came loose from the iPad and I was left to try and fit the protector by eye. I wound up with a large air bubble that would not push out of one corner. I removed the first screen protector and watched the installation video again. This time I was very careful to make sure the guide stickers were securely stuck to the iPad and the screen protector. But once again, after I peeled off the protective film as carefully as possible and started to lay down the protector, the guide stickers came loose and the screen protector fell cockeyed across the iPad.  I give up. Not sure how I could have been more careful. Too tricky for me.
Note: Sparin contacted me and sent two new screen protectors and advised me to use Sparin A02 installation instructions (without guide stickers. Here's what I wrote to them: I managed to get a screen protector installed and it stays in place in the case I ordered. It was tougher to get the protector centered correctly because the piece of tape used to remove the protective film was on the opposite end of the protector from what is shown in Sparin A02 for installation without guides. Just thought you should know for quality control purposes. The protector had to fit precisely, otherwise the edge of the case pushes it up off the screen. All is currently well as the screen protector is in place and the unit is in its case. I managed to get a screen protector installed and it stays in place in the case I ordered.

It was fairly easy to install, looks good, is unobtrusive and does not interfere with the operation of my iPad (2017).  The thin tempered glass pane is packaged well protected in a cardboard book like container with decent instructions that you will need to pay rather close attention to for best results.  It is a good item that serves it's intended purpose, to protect the screen of your device.  Possibly no better quality than similar items from other competitors, but at least as good.

The high quality of Sparin’s screen protectors is evident from day one. Excellent, protective packaging including the way Sparin uses a  peel-away sheet and a padded sleeve. Sparin’s user friendly installation method includes temporary adhesive hinges (with a no-stick tab fo easy removal). For extra assistance, there’s a YouTube video. Great protection, scratch resistant, affordable and no more bubbles! I use Sparin protective glass on all our smart devices. A+",1

1578434675-4529,Whovian 2006,"Great screen protector, instillation process needs improvement","This is a good screen protector. Thick, sturdy, actually has a full cutout for the fingerprint sensor (unlike some I've seen), and is crystal clear. I give it 3 stars based on their install process, and my recommendations for a better install. Due to a job I previously held I used to do screen protector installations on a daily basis, and have installed countless screen protectors. With that said, I was intrigued by their sticker hinge install idea. I thought it might be the best install process I've seen yet, however the stickers didn't stick well to the screen protector, and stuck too much to my iPad, leaving a residue that I had to rub off. Their dust magnet tool also leaves residue on the screen, so I recommend to skip the dust magnet step. A microfiber and some elbow grease can get a screen perfectly clean. I recommend cleaning the screen before attaching the sticker hinge as while cleaning, if your iPad moves on the table, it drags the screen protector across the table potentially scratching it. Use lots of light and turn off ALL the fans/air conditioning or heating to keep as much dust from floating around as possible. wait about 10 minutes after everything is off to let the dust settle, then clean the screen very well. Tempered glass screen protectors show dust under the screen protector much more obviously than typical vinyl screen protectors. I have also docked another star for the poor bevel on the fingerprint cutout, causing it to be somewhat sharp. I hope this helps. If the supplier reads this, please update your instructions with my recommendations to assist future customers.",0

Purchased 2 screen protectors in March, 2019 because the reviews were so good. I never had glass before and it seemed like a great product. Now, 7 mo later, the screen is deeply scratched on the bottom which I saw last week. Last night I saw a deep gash on the left side and today I see a crack from the left side to the gash and then down to the bottom of the left side. I have no idea why this happened. My iPad is in a case with a keyboard which is made for it. I don’t leave my iPad open when not in use and I put nothing on top of it. Very disappointing. I am an adult, not a kid and try to be careful. I won’t purchase again. I’ll go with plastic.",1

I agreed and was promptly mailed a new screen protector for my iPad. This speaks volumes for this company. Even though I wasn't 100% satisfied with their product at first, they still made every effort to ensure my happiness.

I had not had a glass screen protector in the past so I was a little bit skeptical, but by following the instructions, it went on quite smoothly and with no problems. I have to admit I watched a number of YouTube videos and most of them were not very clear in their instructions, so you have to be careful to make sure you understand every step of the process. I like this brand in particular because the application items they included were larger and easier to use than some I saw in the videos. So on that basis alone, I would recommend the Sparin brand. It is a little touchy to get positioned just exactly right, that the positioning tabs are lining the glass up exactly where you want it, and it is essential that the iPad screen be absolutely clean, but then it went on quickly and smoothly with no issues. It was easy to get any bubbles out. I am very happy with this product.",1

One review said to apply the screen protector in a bathroom with the shower running which I did and I can’t say for certain this is necessary but a dust free environment is critical.  Even if you follow the steps exactly, if there is dust around it may show up on the screen. This is by far the best screen protector I’ve ever applied and so far as I’m concerned it’s earned the almost 5 star average rating. The other plus is that I priced a screen protector at Best Buy.

One installation tip: be sure, when pulling the adhesive off the glass (using the handy pull tab), not to let the glass torque and pull of the hinge tape.  It's easiest if you hold down the hinged edge of the glass against the iPad surface as you start to pull the adhesive, and then let it lift up as you get to that edge of the glass.",1

1578434692-4584,Kyle Phipps,Beware potential bad packaging *EDITED 12/3/18*,"As described by other buyers, the screen protector came packaged very cleanly and safely.  All of the materials for prepping the screen came packaged nicely as well.  Unfortunately, the screen protector itself appears to have had several specs of dust/dirt underneath the protective film - not noticeable prior to installing the screen protector, but very noticeable once the protector is on the iPad.  I've read that other buyers have had similar issues.  It is unfortunate, because the screen protector is otherwise great, just a case of faulty packaging.

*EDIT*
Note that this is an update to my original review.  I had originally given this 2 out of 5, despite quite liking the product.
The customer service has changed my mind and I'm willing to give this a 5 out of 5.  Alisa from iMaxas reached out to me immediately regarding my review above, and a replacement protector was sent to me.  This was a completely unexpected level of customer service - very much appreciated.  The replacement protector was particle free and installed perfectly.  Despite the low price, this seems to be a quality screen protector.  It works really well with my Apple Pencil, including pressure recognition for apps that support it.  I will note that drawing/writing with the Pencil feels similar to drawing/writing on a white board rather than paper, however this was never marketed as a paper solution.  If you are looking for a screen protector that feels like paper, consider looking at a matte protector - something that feels grainier.  However, I've enjoyed my time with the protector.  It is a quality product and the customer service is incredible.

One last thing to mention - there is a 2 pack for almost the same price as this one pack.  Buy that one.",1
1578435380-7139,Kelsey Mallard,Great protector.,This Protector is good. The glass seems smooth and protective so far but putting it on was such a challenge.

1578434751-4809,Jennifer,Amazing product. Perfect clarity.,"Sparin tempered glass screen protector comes with all the material tools to install the iPad screen protector perfectly. The screen cleanser takes away all the oils and dirt from the iPad screen. The lint-free dry wipe cloth wipes off the iPad screen sparkling clean without leaving dust. When applying the glass screen protector, the installation package comes with a ""dust collector"" that you can use to take off unexpected dust and lint in the air that attaches to the face of the iPad screen. This will prevent the irritating and frustrating ""bubbles"" that these particles can cause. The outcome results appears as if no screen protector is on... shear clarity if directions are followed and you remove any particles on the iPad screen. I highly recommend this screen protector!",1

Update: these folks are big on customer service! Very soon after I posted my above annoyance, I was contacted by customer service who made sure I promptly got another screen protector at no cost.  I haven't put in on yet, will save it for when I absolutely need it. For now, the holey bubbly screen protector is keeping my iPad well protected from scratches and free of fingerprints and other smudges, which was the main goal. Having an extra screen to take overseas is a huge bonus.  This has been a great Amazon experience, will purchase future screen protectors from SPARIN.  Thanks!",1

I simply cleaned my screen with a microfiber cloth, removed the plastic to reveal the adhesive, then lined up the home button and the sides of the iPad before slowly lowering the protector onto it.  That's it.  Literally had zero bubbles or dust underneath.  The thing that truly blew my mind though was the coating.  I don't know what kind of oleophobic nanotechnology this company is using but it does NOT pick up fingerprints.  At ALL.  I tried smudging and smearing and dragging my fingers all over it.

So, 2 weeks later,  I bought one more glass screen which I put on today--I did a better job but there are still two small bubbles that so far, haven't gone away.  Again I looked at various videos--some vidoes are so old, they do not match what comes in the kit. The kit I used today also included a small plastic chip to smooth the screen (the last one didn't). One of the videos I viewed today suggested putting the guide stickers at the bottom of the iPad Pro, and I think that worked better than videos that advise putting them on the side (which I did last time).  The screen is very well packaged, and comes with everything you need. If the bubbles go away, I will increase stars. I do like the extra protection I hope this screen supplies. Also, the glass seems to not interfere with the responsiveness of the iPad.  UPDATE: tonight I was able to push the two small bubbles out with the cloth, it now is clear, so hopefully, it will stay bubble free.

UPDATED: Great customer service repping a solid product!,"UPDATE: I’ve upped my review to the full 5 stars after receiving a response from customer service—unsolicited—apologizing for the bubbling issue despite adhering like a sensei’s acolyte to the installation process. A replacement product was mailed—also unsolicited—and Alisa, the customer service rep, could not have been more helpful and apologetic. I appreciate that the retailer wasn’t full of mere words but actions backing its product, and to substantiate its confidence, the second screen protector was installed without incident. I admit it seemed like there again might persist some pockets of air but within a couple of minutes they had all adhered. I’ll attach an updated pic soon of the glossy screen.

In all, I’m pleased with it. Yeah, it took some hassle I didn’t seek, but the customer service made up for it. The product works well. I’d purchase again, and I’d completely recommend the product and retailer to others.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: Bubbled in the middle of the screen. See pic. And I had prepped w/ the focus of a neurosurgeon scrubbing in for a craniotomy. I watched the YouTube instructional video thrice (thrice!), reviewed the instructional booklet, prepped my area and iPad, and dug into application. Followed everything precisely as guided. Went well, until it the cruel final.

And the guidance is good, if sometimes lengthy. There are many steps: dry fit the protector w/ the guidance sticker [advice:
APPLY STICKERS FIRMLY b/c they will def slip destroying your handiwork at the final], wet cleaning, dry cleaning, dusting up w/ sticker (a nice feature), and application. The application is nice w/ a quick suction followed by a little bit (theoretically) of ironing out of bubbles.

But my bubble—obtrusive, frustrating, distracting—betrays the point of the product.

Product may otherwise be nice. I can only stare at this diabolical bubble whenever my eye spies the screen and hope it’s sweetly, surely asphyxiated.",1

1578434664-4484,patientdude,Disappears once installed.,"I'm sure most people say this, but I've had more electronic devices than I can count and probably had about 3 times as many brands of screen protectors, most sufficient enough. SPARIN blows them all away. Not only was the installation practical and uncomplicated, once the glass melded to the screen, it all but vanished. Yes, you can see the edge... the button cutout is a hair bigger than the actual button... and the outer edge of the glass itself is also just a hair smaller than the surface of the device's face, not that it matters unless you have something that's 100% bezel-less. But other than this edge, the protector pretty much disappears. It feels like there's absolutely nothing between you and your screen.

Bottom line, from now on I will only buy SPARIN glass screen protectors. Even the price is fair. The packaging alone feels so premium you'll think you got a crazy discount on a high-end product. I bought these for both my wife's IPAD (6), and my Surface Pro 6. I will post this same review on both versions of the screen protector.",1

Followed the directions, but when I took the protective backing off as described, the sticky hinge they provided did NOT stick (tho pressed very firmly) to my iPad and my screen protector was VERY crooked. So I gently lifted it to straighten. When lifting it, dust and dirt attached the underside of the protector (not the screen, screen was spotless still) Couldn't remove dirt from sticky side of protector, so now I have flecks ALL OVER the screen. No can do. And it all started because their ""hinges"" didn't adhere to the iPad. Might be better to just align it yourself without the ""hinges"".

Unfortunately, I picked the wrong install video, even though I followed the printed instructions to look it up on YouTube.  The manufacturer's video didn't show up in the first few choices, so I picked the most viewed video.  Would be nice if there was a better way to find the manufacturer's video, like maybe through a link at their website.  Despite the confusion, the install went well but I couldn't get 3 trapped bubbles out.  They were about dime-sized.  Since I could move them around with the card provided, I knew they weren't trapping a dust particle.  I just couldn't get them all the way to the edge to get them out.  The instructions said any bubbles should go away in a few days, and they were gone within 4 days.

At this point I’ve spent about two hours cleaning and reapplying and desperately trying to get rid of two bubbles that are permanent no matter how many times I remove the protector. Each time I try to fix the issue it gets worse, so I think I’m going to remove it completely and try a different brand.

It fits the screen super well, though, for my 6th generation iPad. And it feels like it would provide quality protection if I could get rid of the bubbles.",0

After using the sticker guides, it did not fix into the previous intended position. Had to readjust several times in positions after sticker on screen was peeled. After much usage of a gas duster to prevent dust, there is a permanent bubble at the bottom right edge of the screen (the sticky part of the screen seems to have worn out and does not stick to the ipad screen). On top of that, when trying to take of the ""guide stickers"", there are residues of the sticky part (cheap material?). I've had no problem with installation of Sparin's Iphone 7 plus screen, but the ipad pro installation is just a terrible experience. Only 2 stars just for the nice packaging.

1578434670-4509,Viktoria,Unhappy,"It’s not glass at all, it’s flexible thick plastic.
Also, I read many reviews that said that no matter how much they cleaned they still got bubbles due to lint. Thats exactly what happened to me. I was installing protector onto my brand new iPad. Even though it was brand new, we still cleaned it. There was absolutely no lint or dust on it. We install this cover and there are 4 bubbles due to dust/lint trapped underneath. This cover I guess is static and attracts dust and lint and pulls it in not the sticky side. So now I have permanent bubbles.
So I am confused. This company reaches out to unhappy customers (which is nice) but keeps on selling effective product? Do you notice many many reviews dating their rating due to great customer service? How about getting product fixed so that it doesn't have static and attract dust/lint. How about product getting better instead of great customer service. Well, anyway I have bubbles and its awful.

The secret is in the preparation. Get the screen as clean as you possibly can and do not touch the sticky side of the protector. If I have any quibbles it is that the screen is very glossy. Seems more glossy that before so more reflections than some screen protectors. It also is supposed to minimize fingerprints. Not sure on that score, but it does clean up nice and gives a sharp unobstructed view of your screen.",1

Unfortunately, unlike my phone's vendor, I could not tell which side had the protective film because it was crystal clear - and usually that's a good thing.  I mean, I REALLY thought I had the correct side down before attaching the ""hinges"" but no - and that REALLY jacked up the process.  Despite my efforts with cleaning with profession microscope cleansers no less - I have smudges and bubbles that make using my Ipad quite distracting.  And after reading the reviews more carefully, what I thought were my additions of particulate matter may have also been there.  Giving three stars however because a smudgy, bubbly screen protector is better than no protector at all.  At least I hope so.

Upon unveiling the protector, I noticed a few things: 1 - it was not flimsy, and yet it was not incredibly thick and heavy. 2 - It did not easily bend, which led me to believe that this was no cheap plastic. 3 - it was crystal clear and unmatted, unlike most screen protectors. 4 - included in the box were a set of instructions (with pictures) and things to clean and de-dust the screen for when you apply the protector.

Applying the screen was easier than opening the package. For me, it NEEDED to be perfectly centered on the iPad, so accomplishing that, for me, was difficult. There were zero bubbles. I noticed a speck of dust in the corner keeping the protector raised a bit, so lifting the protector to remove the speck was easy, and it left no adhesive residue.

The end result is flawless. It looks and feels like the true screen of the iPad. I will be purchasing another one, just in case.",1

I attached the guide stickers as instructed and it did take some finesse to keep them on when the protector wasn’t flush against the screen (either while removing dust or pulling the plastic off of the protector), but considering that was the most challenging part it wasn’t that bad.  I skipped the wet and dry wipe downs, as I literally was just taking the iPads out of their boxes and plastic wrapping, so there was no dirt, fingertips, smudges etc.  I wasn’t going to take chances with dust though!  I went over every inch of the iPads several times with the dust-removing sticker before attaching the guides, after attaching the guides and after removing the plastic film from the screen protector (several times after this because I’d seen a review that said peeling the plastic film off causes static electricity which attracts dust), I was taking no chances!  It seemed to do the trick, as I slowly pulled the screen protector back into place over the screen, it began to seal out the air and “attach” to the screen perfectly.  No air bubbles and I didn’t even need to use the little cardboard square they provide to smooth away air bubbles.  As I did this with the 2nd and then 3rd iPads, I kept waiting for the inevitable air bubble.  I went 3/3 with not a single air bubble!  My guess is because the iPads were brand new.

I didn't leave quite enough length to fold over the top of the screen to hold the protector. So when I removed the stickers to replace them they were not as sticky. Make sure you do this on a flat surface so there is enough room for the protector to lay beside the iPad or the stickers will start peeling off the protector, which probably would not have happened if I didn't have to replace he stickers.",1

First, the hinge concept didn't work well for me.  When I removed the protective sheet from the glass, the glass came off the hinges.  Second, the paper hinges were hard to get off the back side of the iPad,  Lastly, there was an air bubble that got trapped and I had to pull the glass back up.  Thankfully the glass didn't crack and no bubbles the second time down.  Overall, I like the glass protectors better than film ones I've used in the past.",1

It's made of a thin sheet of tempered glass so it feels just like the iPads screen: glossy, slick and easy to maneuver around. The one thing I've found that's disappointing, is it attracts finger prints like no body's business! There is no anti-fingerprint coating so I find myself cleaning it frequently but as far as protection, fit and look go, it's great. The screen itself comes with easy to follow instructions, tools to place the screen and tools to clean the device first to ensure a flawless finish.

The entire perimeter of the screen protector would not fit on the screen flush resulting in air pockets all the way around and dust getting stuck to the adhesive within this gap. This then creates the screen protector to slowly remove itself because of this. I thought maybe I had a defective one and I had bought two of these, so I would use the other one. Nope the same thing happened and I wasted my money on two of these. Everything else was good except that it does not fit properly around all the edges of it.",0

1578434684-4559,Bangarang143,"Good for most, not for me.","I hesitated to purchase this in fear that it would do exactly what it did..

Let me start by saying this screen protector is probably fine for most people. However, I am one of those extremely picky and borderline obsessive people when it comes to the way my device's screens look and perform.

CONS:
Glare... The screen of the iPad Pro is something very unique in that it has a new anti-glare coating that works extremely well. Especially when outdoors. I primarily use this iPad when flying my Phantom drone so this is very important to me. I thought maybe there was a chance that putting this thing on would only slightly degrade this anti-glare coating, but boy was I wrong! Having this protector on the iPad made it almost unusable outside - worse than the Air/Air 2 screen. Bottom line here, it's a shame to even think about putting anything over the iPad Pro's stock glass!

Distortion... I noticed that aside from the glare, at certain angles the picture was slightly distorted. There were also strange rainbow-looking artifacts in certain lighting which started driving me crazy.

PROS:
Packaging... The protector comes packaged extremely well with ample instructions and tools to get it installed correctly.

Oleophobic coating... The glass is covered in a film that feels silky smooth when you touch it and also repels fingerprints and dust very well.

Price... You can't beat the price of this thing for what you get.

Customer service... This company has been great to work with. It's always comforting to purchase from a company that takes pride in their product.

CONCLUSION:

If you're not going to be using your iPad outside a whole lot and you are not a snobby perfectionist like myself, this is a great option.",1

I followed the instructions to the T.  The cover slide on like butter and then there was a bubble...ugh!!!  I decided to let it rest for a few hours and the bubble disappeared on its own.

1578434715-4678,Booklover,Nice product!,The screen is very nice and high quality and fits perfectly once on correctly.  I followed the directions as best I could and still had some difficulty in getting it on straight. It was very very quick to cling to the ipad as soon as I started to place it - it almost felt like a magnetic pull to the screen and it wasn't straight.  I had to lift it to re position it and again it clung quickly but straight this time and I noticed a small fingerprint on the backside of it but wasn't going to lift it again to retry.  I wish it had a thin film on the front of it with tabs to hold on to until it is in place.,1

Only reason why I didn’t give five stars is because it is not bubble free as the packaging says. I feel like bubble free is sort of impossible though... It isn’t a huge deal, I only have a couple of tiny bubbles that are hardly noticeable when there isn’t a black or dark backdrop and the main goal of a screen protector is to, you know, protect the screen. They shouldn’t advertise as bubble free though. Otherwise, awesome product!!!",1

I was worried that my new ipad would just implode on contact of my house since I have two young (and destructive) sons.
I nearly had a heart attack when my eldest told me that his brother had been JUMPING on my ipad. The screen was cracked he said. You can imagine my relief when I saw that it wasn't the screen that was broken, but the protector!

1578434670-4503,GS,NOT IMPRESSED....,"Another example of ""you get what you pay for"".... Installing a screen protector is not rocket science. I've installed the tempered glass protectors on every smart phone and tablet inner house.... at least 2 dozen over the last five years. I am very careful to clean the screen and I always clean off my desk to eliminate dust/ pet hair / etc.... I know the routine. This screen protector was a whole new level of frustration. No matter what I did, it had air bubbles between the screen and tempered glass protector. I was able to remove it, clean the screen again... The end result is shown in the picture. That's the best outcome I could get. After a bit of research I found reports that said not all screen protectors are created equal. Cheap manufacturing processes can allow a very slight distortion in the tempered glass protector and air bubbles will appear immediately or within a few days. I'll spend a few more dollars and get a brand I've used before on our tablets. That will either prove my point cheap manufacturing or make me the idiot.... either one is possible.",1

I've ordered this exact product 4 times over a period of two years. First one lasted 7 months(dropped it). Second one lasted over a year(corner started to peel). Third one lasted 4 months. Fourth one (latest) lasted less than a week. I haven't changed the cover or way I handle the iPad between the third and fourth one, nor have I dropped it. The last one developed large scratches, which quickly spread to become huge cracks across the surface. I'm not sure if the quality has changed since I first bought this.

I tried applying it anyways and while the protector fit nicely the underlying scratches were obvious.  The defect was diminished when the Ipad was on, except in bright scenes etc..

By the time I got to step 5 or so, I realized that what I did earlier (removed the protective film) was a mistake.  Therefore, I got dust, etc. between the new protective screen and my iPad.  Even the smallest mote of dust causes a bubble where the protective screen does not adhere properly.  I screwed around for 10-15 minutes until I got passable results.  Was I to blame?  Partly, but the instruction could definitely be better. Or I should have read through all the instructions before I started.  Also, I'm not sure what I expected, but this screen protector is labeled ""tempered glass"".  It's a piece of plastic--like other screen protectors I've purchased.

The vendor immediately contacted me and sent a replacement.  Since they went to that much trouble, I tried the product again. The installation kit has 3 items in it and the instructions only talked about two of them.  The words used in the instructions don't match what the labels have on the items.  I realized that when the instructions talk about the ""microfiber cloth"" it's actually the ""DRY WIPE"" they are referring to.  When you use the stickers to place the item USE ALL THREE.  This makes it much more stable.  I did NOT use the DUST thing the second time and things went much smoother.  You might have to use it if your device is not brand new.  Thankfully mine was new.  After all that - it went on smooth as silk --- no bubbles or dust on the screen under the shield.  I'm very happy with their customer service and would use their products again.  Thanks!",1
1578434672-4518,Richard Vogel,***Updated Review**** Buy a brand with a true template to install,"***Updated review Dec 10 2019, changed to four stars.  Seller contacted me and offered replacement, which I did not want given the lack of installation hardware vs ""stickers"" used for alignment.  They offered and provided a refund, which was generous.

As I mentioned in my original review, the glass took three attempts to align properly, but it is holding on my son's iPad.  The glass is clear and appears to be of the quality represented. ***

Terrible installation experience.  Sticky tabs to create a “hinge” to align are useless and don’t stick to glass when attempting to adhere. Needs a guide template like every other respectable brand comes with.

Glass hardness seems fine, took three attempts to adhere however, so time will tell if it sticks.

Buy another brand that has a true installation template, not worthless stickers and and a joke of a YouTube installation video.",1

1578434732-4732,JB,Quality Product Good Protection,"The protector is just as advertised. You get cleaners and pads for cleaning your screen before you install the clear cover. I found the method pretty easy, just follow the directions. As to the protector, it seemed pretty good quality, fairly thick and sized properly. One thing the directions don't tell you is that you will need to get the air bubbles out. For this step, once you have the protector attached to the ipad and have already cleaned the screen, remove the clear plastic protection which exposes the ""sticky"" side of the protector and then simply curl it and roll it onto the screen. If you do wind up with some bubbles, simply work them out with a soft cloth or burnishing pad towards ONE end, not all over the place.",1

I jumped on Apple support and added the Apple Care for 2 years; paid the $49 in addition to the Apple Care and had a box shipped to me to repair the iPad screen. But as I was taking the outer protective shell and this tempered glass off, I was shocked to see that the iPad was NOT cracked- the tempered glass was! This screen protector completely saved the iPad's screen! It absorbed all of the blow. THANK YOU for such an amazing product. Ordering two more to keep handy- these kids around here are dangerous to iPads!",1
1578434682-4543,BOMBAY prince,Where were you all my life.,"Product is mind blowing. I installed on two iPad. Installs with such a ease. No bubbles whatsoever.
Don’t be a fool by dropping down and think you got it.
Instead let it down from one end and let the product do the rest.
If you see bubble take the provided plastic white piece and squeeze the bubble out. Then put some heat from your thumb right on that dot and wallah all done.
Please don’t let NEGATIVE reviews bother you. Simply because if you don’t know so do they. If you will mess it up so did they.
If I can do it then so can you. I also added these cases to my iPad. By Fintie USA. Truly amazing product.

1578434678-4538,Amazon Customer,Cracked very easily,"I purchased this product because it had good reviews. When it came, I watched the YouTube video before even attempting to install this. I watched it a second time while following the installation steps. My first issue was with the installation stickers. I applied them to the screen and then unstuck them and repositioned them to get the screen protector more even around the home button. After that, the stickers did not stick well, making the protector crooked right before I was ready to pull off the protective layer and install. At some point a crack formed on the side opposite the home button. I decided to try to continue installation to protect the iPad until I could replace this protective glass. I gently tried to unstick the installation stickers and reposition which then resulted in a huge crack. Now I'm not sure if I should even try to install this temporarily until I can get a new one or if installing it might cause the screen protector to scratch the ipad screen, especially when removing it. Very disappointed.",0

They sent me another screen protector that did come with better stickers which helped me put on the screen proctector perfectly this time!!

My issues the first time: My main problem with this was that the guide stickers sucked. They didn't really stick to the glass at all. Thankfully I was able to get it on right mostly (stickers that worked would have been helpful) though when I tried to fix it. The side of the glass where I was trying to pick up looked like I was ruining the glass itself so I left it alone.",1

1578434678-4537,Katie,Love this screen protector,"Pros:
-Extremely easy to install
-dust stickers were very helpful when removing pet hairs and dust
-feels better than the iPad screen itself

Cons:
-was a hard to push the bubbles out but it was much easier to just lift the screen and continually push the air out to prevent bubbles from forming
-because the protector goes to the outer edges of the screen, my case wasnt made for that extra height and pushes the screen up creating air pockets at the corners (as seen in the picture).
-perhaps a little too smooth (due to oleophobic coating) making it a bit harder to control the apple pencil when drawing
-finger prints only appear when my fingers are slightly moist (can only be seem when the screen is off) but disappears completely with a wipe of my sleeve so fingerprints are hardly an issue

Overall I love this product and it works well. I didn't test its scratch resistance but the hairline scratches I had on my iPad screen  itself  before are no lover visible.",1

You really have to get your iPad, iPhone super clean and not a speck of dust anywhere. And then line up the screen protector with your iPad screen precisely. Don't rush it, let it grab your screen and push out the bubbles on its own. After, take your finger to push out any bubbles left. Push them all the same direction or they won't get out. You can redo, but ideally is best to get it right the first time. Whatever you do, do NOT touch the sticky side AT ALL once you pull back the film. This will only create a forever smudge on your screen because of it. Basically just follow the directions exactly. Awesome and great product, durable and packaged very nicely.

1578434869-5251,Nick S,Wanted to love it,"This item seems like it should be perfect for what all iPad users need, but the installation processes made the item useless and a waste of money.  The instructions call for using sticker tape to align the cover and install it, but once you remove the protective film to install, the stickers come off and the item no longer lines up right which makes you reposition it and then dust and fingerprints get underneath it and it's useless. And make sure it's lined up perfectly or your case will crack the corner which is what ended up happening in the end so to me it is money wasted.",0

Took sometime to get the bubble out of the tempered glass,  had to remove installation multiple times to install without any bubbles.

Because I'd to remove the screen multiple times, one of the edge caught dust from my fingers which shows up.  Would have been 100% happy if screen is completely dust free, anyways it was my mistake can't hold against the product.

The residue showed up again, but like the first time it cleaned off with the provided wet cloth.  I hurriedly installed the glass as instructed and it went on very well.  There were two small bubbles near the edge and those worked out with the provided hard cardboard tool.  I did trap one speck of dust under the glass at the very edge of the screen.  It was annoying but I fault my haste rather than the product itself.  I wasn't about to try to pry it loose and remove it.

I was very caution as I placed the protector down onto the glass, but it melded seamlessly to the iPad screen, not one single bubble of air or particle of dust!! You can't even tell its there!
I have had many phones and electronics over the past 15 or so years and applying a screen protector is something I dreaded doing because they never came put just right. This was super easy and came out perfect the first time!
Take your time, watch the video, and follow the directions carefully and I am sure your installation will be as seamless as mine! Thanks!",1

Previous review:I watched the YouTube video, followed all directions to a T and there is still a bubble that won’t adhere to the screen. I’ve used the little card to try and run it out, but nothing. Not sure it’ll stay on my brand new iPad long as the bubbles drive me crazy. Was worried I’d be wasting $10.",1

This was a perfect fit for the iPad Pro 9.7"" -- I usually have trouble getting screen protectors on my phones/tablets without air bubbles or screwing it up, but this screen protector came with two ""strips"" that make it so much easier to put on after aligning & peeling the plastic off!

Well, I was pretty sure it would still be an issue, but I was very surprised. Following directions very carefully I installed the screen protector perfectly the second time around. You need to be very careful and keep the screen side from getting any dust or fingerprints on it when you do the install.

Probably a nice product, but after applying multiple iphone / ipad screen protectors in the past; I should have gone with what worked for me instead of following the manufacturer's directions.

Specifically, it calls for using the supplied tape pieces to form a ""hinge"" after lining up the screen protector.  Despite using all 3 of the provided hinge tapes; the adhesive was so poor, it pulled right off from my new iPad 9.7.  And once you remove a screen protector; it becomes covered w- dust particles.  Attempting to clean off every dust particle is a lost cause at this point -- I will simply order Tech Armour (or something similar) as I have always used in the past.",0

Thinking about it, I would take a long hot shower, close the room and let all the dust stick to the walls and the air to be still. This will give you a shot at a dust free install.

1578434995-5723,3rd Time is a Charmer,"Great Install Idea, poor quality accessories to execute install properly","This is the 2nd time I bought this product. First time I figured it was like any other tempered glass. I ran the shower a bit in the bathroom to limit the amount of floating dust and lint, and put it on relatively easily and 99% clean of bubbles or dots. THIS TIME I read the included instructions and thought the guide stickers were a clever idea; so I gave it a shot. Wow, did that not go as planned at all! I put open the stickers, tested the hinge set up a few times and started. The corner of the dust removing sticker caught the glass and lifted it off its place. After putting it back on and re-cleaning the glass, 2 of the stickers fell off when I was pulling off the film. I had no choice but to abandon ship and ended up sticking glass on as fast as I could, which resulted in multiple lint and dust spots.

Pros
- Smooth glass. Oil/residue from fingers don't seem to stick to it as much as the IPad's original glass
- Shape is cut pretty exact. If done right there should only be about 1 mm around the edges.

Cons
- Guide Stickers!!
- Dry wipe cloth and microfiber cloth both leave lint

Would have gave it 1 star if this my first purchase, but since I know the glass itself is above average quality, added +1 star.

Update: Got to give Sparin the extra stars for the great customer service. They sent another set for me to put on again. I was determined again to use the guide sticker tabs. Took it slow taking off the plastic right before placement, and the result was a near perfect tempered glass shield on my iPad. Thanks again Sparin!",1

It was easy to install after watching the YouTube demo it tells you to watch after unboxing. I like that sparin provides you a wet, dry, and microfiber towel to clean your screen before installing the protector, because I thought I was going to have to clean the screen myself using some Kleenex’s and I wouldn’t have gotten it as clean if I had did that. I had no problem getting rid of the bubbles once put on the screen the only thing is I got this little circle print of something not sure what caused it because I mad sure not to touch the screen of my device and not to touch the sticky part of the protector when putting it on. It’s no big deal though because once I turn on the screen you can’t see it.

No matter how closely I followed the instructions, I was always left with permanent bubbles under the screen protector, or worse, trapped dust particles.  After spending a large chunk of money for my Apple iPad I knew I would need to install a screen protector to protect my investment.  Of course, based on past experiences I dreaded the whole process.  So after searching for a suitable screen protector on Amazon and reading the reviews, I settled on this one from SPARIN.  Once it arrived, I watched the recommended installation video on YouTube.  In fact, I watched it during the install as well, pausing the video as I completed each step.  To my amazement, the screen protector was quite simple to install, and it turned out perfectly.  No trapped dust, no bubbles, just a sleek, shiny awesome looking screen protector.  This particular glass screen protector does not affect the sensitivity of the touchscreen at all, unlike some I have used in the past.  To sum it all up, this is a high-quality product which was very easy to install.  It looks and feels great on my iPad.  Best of all, I installed it myself without any hassles.

Totally my mistake, so I asked Amazon for the return information and found that after charges the credit was about a 1/5 of purchase price. Not worth the gas to get there. I decided to place it on Craigslist for $5.00, to end up making it free to anyone. My mistake so my review mentioned all you have read. Then a few days later I get an email from The Sparin customer service representative, asking about my review, and that policy related to returns makes it difficult to do. We emailed each other a couple times. To my amazement the Sparin customer service staff processed a full refund.

  I decided to try this one for our new iPad since the kids will be using it a lot. This was super easy to install and it is crystal clear. With a case on there also you can’t even tell that there is even a screen protector on the iPad. I was wondering about if it would be too thick, but the case fit just fine with it on there.
  The touch sensitivity seems to work perfectly with it installed.
  The process they give you to install it works great if you follow the directions to the letter.
  I can’t comment fully on the durability yet but it should be fine. Better than not using one.
  I would recommend this brand 100%. I’m thinking of ordering one for my iPhone.
EDIT: I just ordered a second one of these. This was amazing. One of my children pushed the other while they were holding the iPad. They fell and elbow dropped the screen. The protector did crack but it completely protected the iPad screen. No damage. I couldn’t believe it. Worked awesome.",1
1578434793-4966,Angi J,A Real Review: Tips and Advice,"Before buying this product I read some reviews and I am always skeptical about glowing reviews how easy everything was and how they had no problems. So I went to the 1 star reviews and read those about who struggled and/or how they hated this product completely. There was one women who said not to use the included sticky dust absorber b/c it left sticky residue all over her screen, so I opted out of using the dust absorber and only used the wet cloth (like a lot) and microfiber cloth (I, personally, didn't use the dry cloth). This worked great, I worked to make sure there was no dust left on my screen, like I spent at least 3 mins making sure because I know how much its going to suck if I missed any dust on the screen.

I debated using the guide stickers after reading a review on how they ripped and left sticker streaks on the back of the ipad. I risked it b/c there was no way I was going to be able to get this screen on without them. I read that someone bent/broke thier screen trying to install it and all I could think was 'its is literally package a certain way to prevent/make sure its not bent...why would you bend your screen.' This isn't a regular plastic screen that can be basically folded in half, its a tempered screen. Made to be straight and thick. I only pulled the backing off the screen half way as I was laying it down to make sure the edges lined up and wasn't weird around the home button.

A smart person will have a credit card or something equally flat and rectangular, to smooth out bubbles...because lets face it you will have bubbles no matter what product promises no bubbles. I did the one finger thing across the screen and used my card, wrapped in the microfiber cloth, to smooth out the two bubbles that did form. 1 near the home button (easy to get) and 1 near the middle of the screen that was harder an took a bit longer to get out. After that, I tested my Apple pencil and was really relieved that it didn't affect the way it worked. It was actually smooth (like hand/finger/pencil gliding across) and  nice not to have to worry about scratching up my screen.

Update: 04/24/2017
After having dropped my iPad on its face multiple (waist level and off the side of the couch) and thus having a cracked screen I decided to finally buy a replacement. Once I took off the old one I was suprised that my iPad's face was fine and not cracked at all. I was also shocked at how much damage I did to the old screen.",1

It has to be installed extremely delicately, which apparently I wasn't able to do. I accidentally touched the interior side of the cover which left an irremovable fingerprint on the cover. Not being able to remove it, frustrated, I broke the screen protector and threw it to the garbage. In the process a part of it scratched my skin and made me bleed. Thanks a lot to whomever manufactured this thing. End result can be seen in picture: no screen protector, bleeding finger.",0

1578434715-4674,Jessica Ash,Keeping fingers crossed that the bubble does disappear,"*Updating my rating from 3 to 5 stars. As plenty of reviewers before me have noted, the seller of this item provides excellent customer service. Within a day of my less than perfect review, I was contacted by iMaxas, and was offered a free replacement iPad screen protector. I received the replacement protector within a few days and have yet to replace the existing protector but am hoping for better luck with my second attempt.

Original review: I watched the YouTube instructional video twice,  reviewed the provided Installation Manual, prepped my area and iPad, and followed the step by step instructions exactly as written. Everything was good...until I removed the adhesive “hinges” and discovered a bubble under where the tape had covered the screen while adhering the screen protector. The Sparin Installation Manual does state that “all bubbles should disappear within a couple of days” but I’m skeptical of that since there appears to be a teeny, tiny particle in the center of the bubble that may prevent the bubble from disappearing. We shall see. If it does go away in a day or two, then I will update my review accordingly. If not, I’ll contact Sparin to seek advice.",1

When I removed the backing and began to apply, the stickers came undone. I was able to get the glass applied but it has air bubbles. Also, I tried to remove the bubbles but it just caused small cracks. If I had to try again, I would use suction cups to apply.",0
1578434892-5334,Penelope Foster,Best screen protector that I have purchased ever.,The written instructions were very simple to perform and to understand. The screen protector is the best screen protector that I've dealt with over the past few years. It is sturdy and not like a thin sheet of film. The protector is built to last and no more constant smudges and fingerprints to try and wipe away. I am a senior citizen and received this in my mail today and had it opened and installed on my IPad in about 15 minutes. Thank you.,1

The packaging was worthy of shipping a delicate piece of old parchment without worry of damaging anything. Every item contained was nicely prepaired and well suited for its purpose, even the sticky tabs and wipes were in a ridged envelope on the side. It had a slightly diffrent approach to applying, so much so that I did not deviate from provided instructions. The extra steps paid off as I have never had such a clean and effortless application. And it is not even slightly crooked 🙀😸 The shield in and of its self is sturdy, unblemished and has a good edge. It may be just a screen protector, but I must says I am extreamly pleased with the product and would highly recommend this screen shield.",1

1578434849-5171,Ingsoc,Will break over time,"The case has only one flaw, but its a bad one. Where the cover (lid) locks to the key board, there is a significant difference in the size of the connector vs the size of the socket,, which results in a lot of play and flex when opening or closing the unit. I would estimate about a 1/4 of an inch of travel occurs when you open of close the unit, which causes pressure to be applied to only a part of the socket instead of the entire socket. If not for this issue, I would say its a great case.",0

The second one took me about an hour to put on following the instructions....ended up okay, but will not recommend or ever use these again!  Needless to say, still need to purchase something for the second iPad.  Don't purchase, have to be better options out there.

The crazy thing is it broke when I was on a flight and it was in my computer bag. My iPad pro has a case on it so the screen was not exposed. It is still a mystery how it actually broke.

I would not recommend this product. Waste of money.

I have 2 other iPads and I have had the same screen protectors on them for over a year and neither one of them even have a chip in them and I have used them everyday. I have dropped stuff on them and they have stayed string. Not sure why this product is so flimsy and didn't last.",0

The one thing I didn’t like was that they give you 3 sticky pads to help you install the screen protector. The instructions say to use them as a hinge on one side, but this did not work well at all. The screen protector was binding with the side of the iPad, so I had to remove the 3 sticky pads.

So the screen protector seems to be very strong.,1

First I just have to say that the packaging of the product alone was impressive. The tempered glass screen protector comes packaged in what almost looks like a book; it's a hard cardboard case that opens just like a book and protects the heck out of the product, A hard squishy rubber barrier further encases the screen protector within; then it's even wrapped up in more protection like a poly envelope that you can just slide it out of. I followed the manufacturers advice and watched the YouTube video on installation (search for SPARIN A09) and I felt confident enough I could do it. I did use the hinge method recommended (I had read some reviews where people didn't like it) but I thought if I started with the hinges and felt uncomfortable or like it wasn't lining up then I just wouldn't use them. But it worked out perfectly! And I loved watching the screen protector adhere itself onto my screen - it was awesome! I would buy this all day long, it was that amazing and that much fun to watch. Plus- device protected! Boom!",1

This one offered by SPARIN is honestly the best one I have ever had to please of putting on my screen. Very well packed, great instruction and all tools necessary are included, definitely liked the ""hinge"" method.",1

1578434678-4534,Rosalia’s Reviews,Customer service responded same day and was very helpful!,"Remember not so man years ago when you needed someone at the store to properly put on the screen protector or you'd put it on yourself and forever be plagued with bubbles and no way to salvage the protector with a second chance at applying?
No worries with the Sparin brand! Directions were clear, the glass was easy to apply in the correct position, and if you end up with bubbles, they are easily to work out by gently putting pressure behind them and push out to the closest edge.
Customer service was amazing when I left my original review of 4 stars since I purchased the wrong size thinking this was for the newest iPad released in the summer of 2017. Sparin was quick to help me remedy the error.
So while there are tons of companies out there selling very similar products, I will purchase from Sparin for my future screen protecting needs knowing they have fantastic customer service. No worries with this purchase when you know they stand behind their products.",1

1578434715-4671,Daniika,"Super clear, easy to apply.","Pretty easy to apply. I’ve found the best way is to slowly lay it down, then go back and peel back each corner gently. That’ll get rid of any bubbles left in the middle that are difficult to push to the edges. The cleaning wipes that come along with it are great, they don’t leave any streaking. Also comes with a drying cloth, microfiber cloth, sticker to pull up any remaining hairs or dirt, and a couple positioning stickers. I was able to place it without the stickers.

I have applied many protectors to my iPhones, smartphones and iPads with no problems but this screen protector did not adhere to my iPad face too well as one side of the edge developed several air bubbles that were impossible to remove ( 1 small 1 medium and 1 large). If the bubbles were in any other place than the edge, I definitely would have returned it. Because I am an anal perfectionist, I will be looking for another screen protector that will do a better job than this expensive ten dollars for a single screen protector did. Any suggestions?",0
1578435210-6526,C,Easy to use and video available on Utube for visual ...,My Sparin IPad screen protector arrived quickly and package was very professional. Easy to use and video available on Utube for visual help. I needed to remove old screen protector and I used wax dental floss to lift and remove. I will order again when needed for my other household devices with no hesitation.,1
1578434697-4609,Adrian R.,"Good. DO NOT LIFT AND RE-APPLY as it might not stick all the way, around the entire perimeter of your device's screen.","Seems fine. Good quality. The claim that you can stick it on the screen and pull it up if you made a mistake during alignment, isn't true.  There was a portion of the glass NOT sticking onto the iPad screen and no matter what I did, it'd lift enough just to know it was there. Fortunately, that unused portion of the screen (the surrounding glass frame around the screen) is covered by the protective cover I'm using so it's actually being sandwiched down at all times and out of sight.  Without that, I would I have probably sent it back.

When you apply this cover, MAKE SURE YOU ARE TOTALLY ALIGNED BEFORE YOU STICK the tempered glass protective cover onto the iiPad's screen! If you have to re-lift and re-apply, you'll most likely run into the problem of having a corner or two, not sticking all the way.",1

Even though I installed screen when my ipad was fresh out of the plastic, I used the wet wipe, dry wipe, cloth, and dust catcher to make sure the screen was clean.

1578434684-4557,Sandra Viana,Kit did not come with dust removal sticker. Guide stickers do not stick!  Screen full of dust.,"The 2 star rating isn't necessarily for the tempered glass itself, but for the means of installation.  It should be first noted that my kit did not come with the dust removal sticker, so I was unable to complete that step as written in the instructions, as well as the steps in the video on YouTube. I always apply my own screen protectors to my devices, so I have relatively good experience with placing screen protectors.  When applying this one however, the screen protector kept sliding around as I was trying to measure the placement due to the protective sticker on the protector.  Also, when trying to place the guide stickers onto the screen protector for alignment, they always kept popping off and I would have to realign the screen and press the guide sitckers on again (this happened 3 times). I cleaned the screen as instructed, and as noted before, I could not complete the dust sticker removal step, as my kit did not come with one.  Dust still remained on my screen because of the microfiber cloth (keep in mind, I was installing the protector in a relatively dust-free area).  After removing the protective sticker from the glass, I flipped the glass as instructed and the guide stickers once again came off, adding more time to the installation process, therefore allowing some dust to settle onto the adhesive side of the tempered glass. There are dust particles stuck under the glass now and there are still some bubbles remaining. Very disappointed.",0

But once done, it is awesome, cannot even make out that you have a screen guard on ! the guide stickers (to work as hinge) when mounting makes it so easy for a novice buyer to install as well !! But be patient to absolutely clean the surface spotless and use the sticky dirt cleaner as the last step to remove any micro fibers left by the cleaning cloth. This package comes with all the necessary cleaning and assembling materials. Very happy with the purchase. bought it along with this case (New iPad 2017 Case,iPad 9.7 Case,XIQI ArmorBox Three Layer Kickstand Armor Defender Heavy Duty Shock-Absorption Full Body Rugged Hybrid Protective Case for Apple iPad 9.7 inch,Black Blue). The case could just about tightly fit the ipad after mounting the guard. If you are buying any case, please let the screen guard dry for 15 minutes or so else you might get bubbles in the corner when you snap on a case.",1

1578434786-4931,jordan alvarez,"Slow, and steady!","This kit gives you all the tools for a human hand with plenty error to apply a perfect screen cover with no problems at all. The ""hinge"" Guide stickers are a brilliant idea, but they dont stick well so you have to rub them into place very well, and be careful when peeling the final screen cover or else too fast and the hinge sticker comes undone. Take your time, use all the tools they included which is Wet/Dry wipes, squeegee,Guide stickers,dust absorber, and cloth. Also directions help a lot too. This was the most successful acreen cover I've ever applied out of the 20 or so I've done. The screen cover itself looks fantastic, and is only a fraction of the price of identical products at best buy. Thank you Sparin, super premium product.

The replacement installments came out perfect in first attempt. Secondly, because of their excellent customer service, I decided to order from them again when it came time to protect my iPad Pro, even though there were cheaper options on Amazon, but SPARIN's product guarantee has me hooked as their returning customer. By the way, my iPad glass protector install came out perfect in first attempt. The company provides all necessary tools for easy installation. I personally, used scotch tapes to hold down the included self adhesives. Learned my lesson from the first two failed attempts.

1578434713-4665,junichiroaki,Great screen protector.,"I really enjoy this protector so far. It covers the entire glass almost seamlessly. There's a tiny gap on one side but it's unnoticeable with my covers on. The edges are rounded and smooth so using the button isn't irritating.

The protector was really easy to apply, much easier than my phone's protector. It comes with the standard wet and dry wipes, microfibre cloth and squeegee card. I didn't even need the card. I laid it down button edge first and let it fall. A slight push in the middle made all the bubbles go away.

The protector's oleophobic properties are working great so far, much better than the original screen. There are still a few smudges here and there, but I clean my screen a whole lot less now. I use a generic stylus sometimes to reduce fingerprints but now I use my fingers more because there are less prints. Oh yeah, the protector doesn't affect the function of my stylus either.",1

The directions were easy to follow especially since this was the first screen protector I've put on any device.  It is also definitely a bargain.  I am going to put one on my wife's next iPad since her current one is cracked up really badly.,1
1578435116-6172,Bucky Goldstein,Skip the hinge stickers and use patience instead,"I was able to apply this to an iPad Air 2, and it came out pretty well.  As a side note, it might be a good idea to wipe the protector down on its face and edges with the wet alcohol wipe before removing the protective backing. I didn't have any air bubbles I couldn't work out, although I ended up with a big piece of dust on the edge after removing the backing.  A quick and careful lift with a razor blade, and a touch with the dust ""absorber"" took care of it. Using the ""hinge"" stickers, it lined up perfectly before removing the backing, but the alignment didn't stay the same and it started sticking to the screen before I could adjust it, so the thumb hole was a little off.

I ended up removing the protector from the iPad Air 2 and applying it to an iPad (2017) and it looks just as good as, if not better than, the original application.  I used a few toothpicks to keep it off the glass while I made my final adjustments. I still didn't get it lined up perfectly, but I'm much happier with the placement.  I did get a few dust spots, but lifting it up and slipping the dust sticker underneath fixed them.  Again, no bubbles, and little to no evidence of it being entirely reapplied or partly lifted a handful of times.

One ding for the hinge stickers and difficult alignment.  Otherwise, so far so good.",1

On my phone the Sparin screen protector worked better, although still has some issues with placement and dust particles underneath. Hopefully the new one I just bought for my phone will last longer than the old one, which cracked in two places when I dropped my phone with a dual soft/hard case. Luckily my screen is still in tack.
So far not too pleased with the Sparin company and products, although promising, still have some flaws. So for now, my screen protector on my phone is passable, although I'm not overjoyed. But the screen protector on my iPad is horrible and isn't even fully attached at several places around the edges and still has several specks of dust. I followed all your instructions and even watched a video on how to install. But every time you try to lift the screen protector to get a speck of dust, it becomes 'unsticky' where you lifted it, even with the ""dust absorber"" which doesn't work very well. In addition, although the larger guide sliders worked well for the iPad, on the phone they were quite a bit smaller and worthless leaving the protector continually sliding around.
I have emailed the company Sparin and will update this review if things get any better. As of now, I would not recommend such an expensive product that clearly has existing flaws.",0
1578435406-7225,Darren Caldwell,It fits great and really easy to install,It fits great and really easy to install.

1578434767-4868,Amazon Customer,Does what it says on the tin.,"Purchased this for a new 2017 iPad 9.7 128gb LTE.  I needed this as I'm a bit of a klutz and didn't want the hell scratched out of my new iPad's screen.  Installation was a bit nerve-wracking, as I wanted to get it right the first time, but if you follow the included simple instructions, it'll work out.

Here's a few thoughts:

- DO NOT be in a hurry when you sit down to install this thing.
- Clear a 20 minute window of time in a room away from pets/kids/fans/moving air
- Read the instructions and TAKE YOUR TIME!
- Start work on the alignment.  There's no penalty for taking your time.
- Take extra time to gently press the stickers down, as they'll come loose otherwise
- Check your alignment again.  Get an idea of what it looks like along the left corners when aligned properly.
- De-dust RIGHT before you pull the adhesive cover
- Once the glass makes contact and begins adhering, SLOWLY let it settle on its own.  It'll adhere without bubbles if you don't rush it.

If you followed the included simple instructions, it should work out just fine.  I had no air bubbles and it looks great!

I'll update if durability becomes an issue.",1

1578434720-4694,Hondaaloha,Care in attaching important,I love this screen protector.  I didn’t give it 5-stars because of the care you need in attaching it to the iPad.  Follow instructions to the letter and choose a place with no wind or fan.  One speck of dust that you didn’t notice can cause havoc.  My first screen protector had one speck of dust get on it cause I sat next to the window.  Had to throw it out. The second one was done away from any chance dust speck getting on the iPad screen.  Got it on perfectly.  Now it’s great to know my screen is protected.  Works like advertised.  Love having it on.,1

Two days ago I saw that the chip had turned into a crack. The crack grew larger until I finally just removed the protector... which shattered into many pieces in the process. Most of the pieces stayed stuck to the adhesive, but some of them did go flying. So beware when removing. I will say there were several months of use between installation and removal.",0

I did go on the website to look at the YouTube video which helped a lot.  It is so easy to install.  I had a bubble on the lower third of the screen but was able to work it out.  The tabs are very important to use so you don't put smudges on the screen and to align it properly on the iPad.  It took maybe 5 minutes to do.  The price was reasonable too.

They said they would send a replacement with no charge. They also gave me a list of recommended videos on youtube to help install the protective glass. I used the videos that they gave me, and they end result was fantastic! The glass is so light and once it was properly on the screen it looked wonderful. I can't even till it has a screen protector! It works great with simple styles pen that I have, and the quality of the screen isn't degraded by the protector. I would buy this product again. Warning to new users that don't usually install protectors I highly recommend looking at the tutorial videos on youtube to install this product correctly the first time. I don't know if the first try was my error or the companies but I'm grateful for the replacement they sent me to try it again. I'm not disappointed by this product!",1
1578434700-4617,nozama,"Easy to install, air bubble out by natural way","It is easy to install -
1) Let the bottom part of the screen protector touch Ipad's bottom part of the screen edge
2) Align the home button circle with the screen protector hole
3) While still lifting the top two corners, try to align top corners
4) Gradually lower down the top corners which are being hold by two hands
5) If it doesn't fit the corner, lift your hands to re-position gently. It is very easy to come out.
6) If every corners are aligned properly let go of the two top corners
7) While you are letting go of the two corners, you will see air escaping from the protector. This is the most enjoyable moment :)
Good Luck!!!
Note: The above procedure was done on a brand new, out of box unit. Cleaning before installing is important. So make sure the surface is free from lints and grease. There are plenty of small particle in the air that might fall on the surface to cause the air bubble!!!",1

1578435911-9078,T. Spence,Awesome screen protector! Some instruction notes,"First off great product, packaging was nice to ensure the protector itself wouldn't be damaged upon delivery. Researched on a few products but glad I landed here. Like many I was surprised on how much pressure I was applying with Apple Pencil and it became a concern that I would end up maybe damaging the screen itself.

Install was easy but a few tips.

- Have enough space to spread everything out. Just comes with multiple cleaning wipes and surface cleaning tool so make sure you have enough room to have everything in front of you as you need it.
- Apply the ""hinge"" stickers to the iPad first, then position the screen protector, then fold the stickers over onto the screen protector to make the ""hinge."" I feel like the initial conclusion is to position the screen protector, then place the stickers, then fold the stickers behind the iPad. Just made for a hassle in the beginning as I was folding the stickers over and the protector would shift slightly offsetting the alignment.
- Take your time - I definitely screwed up twice with 2 small particles of dust that created bubbles on the first try. I used the provided dust removal film from off the protector's back side as well as the iPad surface. I messed up the second time when I couldn't eliminate an air bubble in the corner. I just took my time and lifted the protector each time to eliminate the flaws. Install was probably 5-10 mins w/ me correcting those mistakes.

Again great product, super happy with the result, screen is still crystal clear and no interference with the touch sensitivity, fingerprint reading, or Apple Pencil.

TLDR: Good stuff.",1

Waste of 10 bucks!",0
1578434765-4851,John Cameron,Best Screen Protector- NO BUBBLES,"I just received and put in on perfectly with no bubbles. It is a glass sheet not plastic so it looks like you don't even have a screen protector on. The packaging was incredible, it was a hard cardboard book with a foam insert and the screen was wrapped carefully inside. It had the cleaning supplies with it. Everything needed for installation was there. This is by far the best screen protector I have ever had and I have used a bunch of them. Also the screen protector doesn't fingerprint and smudge like the unprotected screen does. You tap on the little hinges and when you drop the screen down it just sucks itself on and pushes the air out with no bubbles the first try. No re-positioning needed.
This is as good as it gets and it is so inexpensive too!",1
1578434973-5648,Texas Gal,I Like It,"I'm pleased with the glass screen protector.  It is nicer than the plastic film screen models I had used recently.

1578434906-5383,Skylar,I think it is a great product with one flaw that ruins it,"I think it is a great product with one flaw that ruins it.  It needs to be just a little bit smaller than the face of the iPad itself.  I have a cover that wraps up over the edge just a touch and it is always pushing up at least one edge because you can't get all four corners under.  So it keeps lifting off the screen and getting dirt and dust under it.  If it was just a touch smaller like they make most phone screen protectors these days it would be a perfect product.

update:  The company contacted me and gave me a rebate and a replacement which was nice to get my money back but they said that they have not heard that complaint from anyone else.

Another six months later and it cracks again. I don’t do anything crazy with my ipad. It sits protected in my bag to and from work everyday. After trying it twice there’s no way I’m going back again nor do I recommend buying it. Sure it’s cheaper and worked for a bit but all that money could have just paid for a better one. Buying two and getting the same results isn’t a coincidence its a design flaw.

Unless you live in a house that has no dust particles you’re going to have some small bubbles from the dust. I’m ok with that. What I’m wasn’t ok with is the air bubbles that refused to disappear no matter what I tried. I followed the directions completely and has so much trouble installing this and there were so many bubbles and so much dust from lifting and replacing it so many times trying to get rid of the bubbles I finally lost patience and threw it in the trash.

Installation was a bit difficult -- but if you read the directions and follow them it totally works.  Allow for some time to do all of the cleaning and adjusting to make it fit right.

But the reason for the positive review is that it totally saved my iPad -- I was using the ipad (I keep the stats for our school baseball team on it) and bumped into someone causing the ipad to fall 3-4 feet glass down onto a concrete floor.  I was certain the screen was destroyed and I'd need to replace the screen or buy a whole new iPad.  The screen protector was shattered completely -- but the screen underneath was 100% fine.

The hinge tape didn't stick well and a crack developed on the bottom of the home button cutout.  I contacted Customer Service and they were very helpful and shipped us a replacement once I validated the crack.  I have high standards for both products and Customer Service and Sparin exceeds expectations in both areas.  I have recommended this to multiple friends already.  My only advice on the install is review the online videos, follow the instructions, and go very slowly.  Work from the center to push bubbles to edge.

The trick seemed to be after lining it up with tabs and removing the temporary protector, attaching the glass and pressing your finger down the middle, was suppose to do it.. That is suppose to self remove the bubbles. There is a card to help clear them after but it never set.  It left bubbles that kept coming back after use.

I once went to Apple to replace the damaged screen of an iPhone 6, and it costed nearly$100...

Also, unlike my other screen protections, which resulted in bubbles as you applied, no matter how careful i was, this one had a video that includes creating a hinge, wiping with wet wipe, then drywipe, then remove dust, and finally sticking the sticker, and voi-la! no air-bubbles, just perfect!

1578434682-4541,MissyD35,Stick it right the first time or you will have to trash it,"UPDATED: After giving it 1 star for the review below, I am updating my review.  WONDERFUL customer service!!  As soon as I said it did not work, they offered to ship another one free of charge, no questions asked.  I have it but have not put it on yet as it is for my daughter's iPad.  She has a case on it so I feel safe letting her use it without the glass for now.  But once the newness of Christmas goes away and I can get it away from her (LOL) I will put it on and let you know how it goes!

Followed directions exactly. When it went down it had bubbles that would not come out. Lifted it once to try and clean again. Would not stick again. I keep trying, but ended up having to toss it. A complete waste of money!",1

1578434718-4688,Claudia Rocha,Great experience despite negative reviews!,"I was very hesitant in purchasing this screen protector because of all the negative reviews and to be honest some of the positive reviews sounded fake, but i figured worst case scenario I’m out $10 and lesson learned. Anyway, installing the screen protector was super easy (Disclosure: i have worked for a major wireless carrier for over 10 years so I have plenty of experience placing screen protectors on devices). The only thing I needed help with was placing the little tab stickers on the screen protector and around the back of the iPad to keep it in place. Once I removed the plastic film and flipped the protector over the screen of the iPad the protector pretty much stuck to the screen on its own and surprisingly left zero air bubbles. I bought this screen protector 3 separate occasions (I have 3 kids that definitely need these on their iPads) and i have had the same experience. It is not a “fluke” or “pure luck” that these screen protectors left zero bubbles upon installation. They seriously required zero effort from my part. I understand not everyone will probably have the same experience as mine, but honestly I believe it’s all due to user error. The screen protectors have offered amazing protection to my kids iPads and since they are 9, 7, and 1 you can imagine that they have been tested. Their iPads have been dropped, tossed, and thrown all over the house (okay mostly from the 1 year old, but the protector has lived up to its name. (Disclosure: It also helps having a sturdy case on the iPad).

In conclusion: installation was easy, protection has been excellent thus far, and seriously—it’s only $10. People spend more on one cup of coffee at Starbucks. :)",1

On my first try to install it I ruined it. The stickers that are supposed to keep it in the original position before you take off the sticky side protector weren't fastened properly and they came off. As a result it wasn't positioned correctly and when I tried to fix it, it got ruined. Once you touch the inner (sticky) side it's done - can't be cleaned and can't be re-fitted. Following my complaint the company sent me a new one, and I was able to install it properly.
I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised by the customer service, kudos on that!

The protector is very clear and seems very strong. Really the only down side is that the installation step is delicate with an iPad. You should do it extremely carefully because you only got one shot. Watch the provided YouTube, and fasten those stickers well...",1

I have upped the stars from 1/5 to 3/5 just because of the fantastic customer service. Seller was confident about their product and had sent me a new screen hoping that this would fit better. That said, it was of the same dimensions and I have the same complaint about the product in which the screen protector does not cover edge to edge display.

It's not a huge deal, but I hope this doesn't compromise the warranty of the screen protector or compromise the ""safety of the screen."" They spots are tiny, and I probably can only see them when I turn off the screen.

1578434667-4491,Topper,Avoid Dust Like a Plague!,"I bought two fo these protectors for my wife and my new iPads and they came quickly, were well packaged and are very thin  and clear—in other words, a great start! I watched the YouTube video that was recommended on the instruction sheet before beginning the installation so I would know exactly what to do and what not to do. All went well on the installation until, in spite of my best efforts, I got a couple of small dust particles on the screen that were on the viewing area. The video did not cover how to remove them but I had read another review that said to carefully lift the protector from the corner, use the dust remover the remove the particles FROM THE STICKY BACK OF THE PROTECTOR (in other words, “upside down”)and let the protector return to position. During this process, additional dust crept onto the protector nearer the edge and I carefully repeated the process.  I finally have a screen with no dust bubbles in the viewing area but the corner that was lifted no longer is adheared to the screen.  That’s really no big deal and I’m sure the screen is protected but it does show and bothers me. Bottom line, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE NO DUST ON THE SCREEN  when you install the protector the first time because recovery is very frustrating and the final results may not be as you wanted.",1

Once you cleaned the screen go over it carefully with the sticky pick up pad. Follow the video instructions very closely. I found that an extra set of hands and eyes ( looking for dust on the screen and lining up the screen protector) was very helpful.,1
1578434710-4653,Amanda S,"Too much glare, messes up screen brightness sensor","I am an artist and I use an iPad Pro with the ipencil to do professional work. I tried this product to replace my old screen protector of a different brand.

This screen protector has way too much glare. It's very hard to draw with mirror like reflections on the screen. Perhaps it would work in a dark room -- but as the purpose of an iPad is to be mobile, that would be rediculous.

Additionally, and I really don't know how or what this happens. The automatic screen brightness adjust feature doesn't seem to be working. For those unfamiliar, the iPad Pro has an amazing feature where is senses the lighting brightness and color of the room and automatically adjusts the iPad to deliver a consistent screen brightness no matter the setting. The screen I am currently writing this review on is quite dark. This is very frustrating.

I'm sure the screen protector must have some virtues in strength, but 2 strikes against it have caused me to order a different screen protector to replace this one.

I do not think this is a good choice for the iPad Pro.",0

I had luck with tempered glass covering my other devices in the past, so I was happy to find one for my new iPad (2017). The cut out for the home button and the edges all matched up perfectly with the device. They provide you with all of the cleaning materials (wipes, dust collector, etc.) so you don't need to clean with Windex beforehand. What I thought was a nice touch is they provide you with an instruction booklet, but also give you a YouTube search keyword in case you'd like to watch a video tutorial.

I have a new iPad pro 9.7 and want to keep it as protected as I can and I have to say that this one actually impressed me beyond expectations when I opened the packaging.  It is well packaged, complete, excellent, simple instructions and I can tell you, the experience I had of putting on the protector was the best experience ever in applying a screen protector to an iPad or iPhone.  I'm actually considering getting one now for my iPhone the quality of the one I just got for my iPad is superb.

I was extremely careful so as not to get anything on the “sticky” side and when removing dust.  Unfortunately, there was ‘something’ that appeared to be on the screen before I peeled off the backing.  I thought maybe this would disappear after smoothing out the ‘bubbles.’  It did not.  I now have a ‘murky’ part on my screen.  I did try carefully peeling it back, but it’s permanent.",0
1578434664-4487,Cute 58,Mostly Crap,"Folks giving this a  great review must not have been able  to compare this to the screen savers of years ago.  Most of these things, including this one is made to be as  cheap as possible and most profit.  I ripped this one off my iPad and threw it in the trash.  Not even worth returning.

What I don't like.... too glossy and not matt finish so a lot of glare.  It's not glass and falsely implied in the ad and on the box.  It is a polycarbonate.  Thus it is very static like when installing and attracts dust that you must be super careful to remove during installation.  It leaves even more fingerprints than by using the iPad directly.  It's also just a bit too large.  They try to go edge to edge on the iPad so when putting the iPad in a tight case, the edges of the product  are pushed up or in with pressure and come away from the surface slightly.  It also annoys me that when pressing the home button, I feel the edges of the cutout circle as the product is thick.

I'll go back to try and find the older style very think coatings that don't have the above problems.  They might be a bit more delicate to install, but none of the downsides.  I already have a case that mainly protects the iPad so this this plastic is a nuisance.",0
1578435638-8079,Jayme M.,The screen protector seemed to be a nice quality but I was never really able to use ...,The screen cleaner provided leaves micro fibers behind as well as streaks. It took me longer then it should have to clean the ipod with the drying cloth. Then the sticker / wax paper thing to pic up remaining fibers does nothing and smudges the screen if touched. Even the smallest fiber holds the screen up creating a noticeable bubble. There are no redos with this product. The screen protector seemed to be a nice quality but I was never really able to use it as I had a fiber in the center of the screen upon application. It left a noticable bubble in the center of the screen that I couldn't squeeze out. Taking it off left a residue.  I would have had better luck if I didn't try to use all the screen cleaning things at all. Following directions for this project turned into a huge waste. I ended up throwing the product out.,0

The iPad I put it on was new, out of the box, so it had no blemishes and was factory clean.  Unfortunately, the adhesive on the bottom right hand corner of the protector didn't stick as well as the other sides of the product.

This one was packed securely and came inside a protective case that was sealed tight.

Installation was pretty straightforward. I followed the instruction booklet and read carefully before handling the cover itself.

Note: The pack comes with a wet wipe and a dry wipe packet. It gives instructions to use the wet wipe followed by the microfiber cloth but it does not mention where to use the dry wipe. I felt the wet wipe was a bit too wet so I used a towel to absorb some of the moisture. I did not want to take a chance with my device absorbing some of the moisture although I am sure it would have been perfectly fine. Once I did that I used the dry wipe and then the microfiber cloth. I did notice the dry wipe had a rougher texture but it did not seem to cause any harm to my device.

I set up mine in approx  5-7 minutes but that is including the time it took to properly get all the visible dust particles off.",1

He was very concerned and adamant about sending me another one at no charge, along with additional instructions in video form to help me with the installation.  Eos went out of his way to support me and ensure that I would be successful in applying the IPad protector.  He was in touch with me daily on my progress.  The videos were of tremendous help and I applied it with success.  In fact when I emailed Eos back to let him know my results, I also told him that I was ordering another one for my husband.  Surprisingly, Eos responded back requesting my order number so he could apply a 20% discount to my account for my second order.  I've got to say that his customer service was outstanding and I would highly recommend this product provided by SPARIN.  And for your convenience, they put the the search terms of the setup guide (on YOUTUBE) below.

I read the directions and watched the youtube video (directions to find it included in the instructions!) and prepared myself. My heart was racing. I thought, it can't be that easy. I did take extra time with all cleaning steps to ensure I had done a thorough job. I also was under a light which made it very easy to spot dust. When I flipped over the screen protector onto the iPad, I let it do the work. It self-adhered and I ended up with an absolutely perfect result. I'm so happy I decided to do this myself.

And the screen protector itself is great. I just put it on with no problem (I did watch the video, being an easily-led person), and I expect it to serve me well. In the past I've had film screen protectors, which in fact have worked just fine, but this was easier to put on and should afford even better protection.
One trick I remember from installing my previous covers: do it on a good flat surface in a bathroom after having run the shower for 3-4 minutes and then waited 5"": as it settles, the steam will drag any dust out of the air in an already relatively dust-free space. And no matter where you perform the operation, be sure you've turned off AC or heat blowers before you do the deed.",1

1578434690-4573,Kyle Akin,"Fragile, broke when installing.","I'm giving it two stars instead of one or zero because it comes in very nice packaging (probably too much money spend on packaging) and I can only assume that if installed properly it would work well.  The problem I have is with the installation instructions and how brittle the glass is.  The instructions included were not made for iPad screen protectors, but instead were for iPhone protectors.  The assumption was there is no difference, but there is a little difference.. still, it shows the company wanted to save a few bucks by just re-using the iPhone instructions.  Second, instructions do not explain in English which side of the screen is ""up"" when it instructs you to tape anchor it down.  After anchoring it down I discovered I had the wrong side up and when trying to remove and replace the anchor tape, the screen cracked.  This leads me to believe that the screen is very delicate and would probably crack very easily after installed.  I'm returning for a refund.",0

I also use the Apple Pencil and it works great with the pressure sensitivity also. Before I put the screen protector on I would use the pencil and I felt like it was dragging across my screen kind of in a jagged way that may scratch it. But not anymore.

The glass is smooth, and collects less fingerprints than the iPad's regular glass with no screen protector. It also cleans off fingerprints easier than without a screen protector. My first protector was defective, and part of it wasn't attaching to the general center area of the screen, while also making the screen not very responsive to touch. I contacted Sparin through Amazon, and was set up with a replacement screen protector in under an hour. With Amazon Prime (and living near a warehouse), I had a new screen protector the next business day. Super easy, and hassle free. My replacement screen protector was perfect, and I'm happily using it now.

I purchased the first one when I bought the IPad Pro and it was on my IPad until just the other day when I attempted to place a cover for the back of my IPad that was supposed to be glass cover friendly. It cracked on the corner from taking the back cover off. Since the screen cover fit so well and is very clear I purchased the 2nd one. It is also very easy to install if you watch the viedo and do it slowly. This time I put the back cover on that I purchased then put the screen protector on, well this did not work. One side of the screen protector had a huge bubble because the air could not get out due to the back cover as soon as I the took the back cover off the bubble went away. I did have a spot where it looks like some dust or dirt was on my IPad scree but this was not a big issue with me. I did send an emaI to the seller which was provided by them when I made the purchase explaining that I did not get a good installation of the screen cover because of installing it with the newly purchased black cover. They gave me a few suggestions and then sent me a new cover. Where do you find a company today that stands behind the product they sell as this company did?  I highly recommend the SPARIN screen cover and will buy it again if the need arises. I did send the back cover that I purchased from Amazon which they will refund me as soon as they receive it and will continue to look for another back because I like the idea of good protection of my IPad.",1

This product includes:
1. Stickers to help positioning
2. Screen Cleaning kit (wet cleaner, dry cleaner, microfabric cleaner)

These two help a lot, more than expected. You can completely remove dusts from your screen. And you can very easily place the protector on your screen using the simple sticker kit.

Before this, I always struggled to remove dusts and to place it correctly. I used to try this in bathroom to minimize dusts and detached and attached a film multiple times to find correct position. But SPARIN solved the problems very easily with the simple kits.

I put it on easily this time and so far no cracks have appeared.  Seems protective enough.  Note that when I took the old cracked one off to replace it, the thing cracked all over the place, but more or less held together so I could peal it off.

I bought this in March and it is now cracked in two places for no discernible reason.  One crack is from the edge snaking toward the screen, the other is dead center of screen.  I didn't drop it or drop anything on it.  The cracks simply appeared.  Will need to replace with different brand.",1
1578435284-6810,5outta6,Save your money....,This Ipad screen protector was horrible. After following application instructions it started to de-laminate from the screen about after a week. The next week I pulled it right off and threw it in the garbage.....Luckily there was no adhesive residue on the screen......,0
1578434690-4576,Mellie31553,Ended Well,"First, I am not adept at this sort of task and usually end up with a useable, but not perfect, result. That said, this went on fairly well. The biggest complaint is that the ""guide"" stickers were not adhesive enough to hold the glass in place as hinges, nor to use the third one as a handle to lower the glass onto the iPad. I ended up pulling the protector free of the hinges and just eyeballing it. I got three good sized bubbles toward the top, one silver dollar sized and the other two more dime sized. However, I was able to gently ease a fingernail under a corner and use the small, stiff, smoother to work the largest bubble to the edge. The two small air pockets were fairly easy to work to the edge using pressure on the protector. Once all is said and done, it's on as straight as can be expected - the circle is not exactly even over the button, but the sides look straight, and there are no bubbles nor dust apparent. I'm well satisfied.",1

So I wiped it down again. Only to find out that my very careful cleaning it did not matter.  So I figured hey it’s just hair I’ll try to take it off well no matter what I did it made it worse. Now I just left it to find not one but 7 large bubbles... idk what to do now, it bugs me like crazy. Though looking in the store I found that $4 more and I would have gotten 2 instead of 1.

1578435513-7592,E. Williams,MUCH Better after replacement!,"UPDATE:

After my prior review, I received exemplary service through a replacement of the screen.  Really good follow-up, and true concern that I was initially unhappy.  Thanks Sparin for great service, and addressing my concerns!

This product did not work for me for the following reasons:

1) The instructions that came with ths are for an iPhone, and does not work for an iPad which is what the product is for,
2) It was not clear what side was up or down when the glass was adhered to the screen, so I ended up puitting the hinges on the wrong side - why would I think that the glass should be put on the screen with the words right side up!  Silly me.
3) The package only comes with one glass - really difficult to get it right the first time (which I did not), so you basically end up spending $10 for one shot at it, and if you get it wrong because of inadequate instructions as I did, then you are screwed,
4) The YouTube video sight does not show the product that I was working with - silly me to think that it would.

Poor product instructions resulted in wasted money, time, and still no screen protection.  Since I am one of few with such difficulty working with this, I guess I am the idiot, except I have used other similar products before from a different manufacturer, and never had a problem.  Oh well, stick to what you know.  I will never purchase a product from this manufacturer again.",1

However there was a crack that started at the home button opening and continued towards the left edge.  At first, I thought it might just be a very big scratch on the plastic backing but as soon as I lifted it to get a closer look the crack grew bigger until it reached the left side. If the plastic backing had not still been attached, the entire lower left corner would have broken off completely.

Reviewers leave glowing reviews about how they have dropped their various devices while using this screen protector and have ended up replacing a cracked screen protector that they swear saved their screens from expensive damage.  And that's great, really. But I have to seriously wonder how much ""damage"" my device would actually encounter if left on its own.  I own an iPad and I'm positive my iPad screen can handle much more than this screen protector can.  Based on how that smallish crack by the home button quickly became a crack big enough to completely sever the lower corner, I feel like this screen protector will crack and need replacing for even the most minor of incidents...incidents that most likely would have done nothing to my iPad.

In the end I'm going to keep doing what I've been doing with every tablet I've purchased, beginning with a Nook Color in 2010 and including an iPad 2 and the new 2017 iPad: buy a case that my tablet slides into, like the one I had for my last iPad.Bear Motion Luxury 100% Full Grain Genuine Top Layer Buffalo Hide Vintage Leather Case for iPad 4 with Retina Display / iPad3 / iPad 2 - (Candy Red)

1578435318-6916,Amazon Customer,Very pleased - but don't bother with the sticky tabs when installing,seems to protect fine & very clear - can't really tell it's there.  cleans easily.  Putting it on was a little scary (first one I've done) - but watch the videos & they help.  Bit of advice:  the stick on tabs they give you to help guide it into place are pretty useless - they didn't stick well & I had to left the screen protector and reapply it - wound up skipping them second time and just being very careful to place it.  I'd not bother with them (& the first video doesn't have them; I think they must be a new 'improvement' but frankly installing worked fine without them.  Luckily I didn't crack the protector when I had to remove it the first time to position it correctly (the stick on strips let it slide out of place).  It does not interfere with any buttons or functions & works fine with my cover.,1

This screen and application process was literally the most genius yet simple application and was so simple to do. I've never had such a perfect screen application as I just did with this. No dust, no marks, and it went on perfectly straight because of the hinges you make with the stickers it comes with. Hands down the best screen protector I've ever had. I would recommend this to every single person that has a 9.7 inch iPad!!! You won't regret it. Best $10 spent.",1

1578435227-6590,techuser2941,Great screen protector and easy to install.,The SPARIN screen protector came in a very nice package with all the necessary bits to get it installed. I specially liked the hinge stickers to make it easier to line up and install the screen straight. I did end up with a few bubbles but I was able to get rid of them by pressing on both sides of the bubbles with my thumbs and pushing the air out to the side. Once installed the screen looks great and it looks like it's going to protect my iPad really well. I definitely buy a second one to install on my wife's iPad.,1

The guide stickers wouldn't stay attached and the screen came off my iPad which in turn caused dust to attach to the sticky side and it was pretty much over from there. I've installed screen protectors before and didn't have this problem. It was frustrating.

Although I haven't tried the new screen, the customer service alone desires a five star rating. They supplied me with more information to help with a better install and sent a replacement screen at no charge. The best service I've gotten in a long time.",1

Followed the directions and ended up with a great result!  I did not have a single bubble I'd have to get rid of.  I can't even see that there's a screen protector on - it is perfectly sized and looks like it will do its job.  I'm very happy with this purchase.",1
1578434664-4483,dP,"Only comes with one protector, and alignment is challenging","I've installed too many screen protectors to count on both iphones and ipads.  The biggest issue with this kit is that it only ships with one piece of tempered glass whereas the other kits I""ve purchased from other manufacturers shipped with a second screen protector.

The pull tab to remove the plastic sheet from the tempered glass is at the top, and no camera cutout hole or other cue is available to properly align the protector.  There is only one hole cut out for the home button, and aligning the tempered glass from the top of the ipad down to to the home button is challenging.  If a second hole was present for the camera, installation alignment would be far easier. Alternatively, if the pull tab was located on the bottom of the glass near the home cut out, the alignment would be much easier.

Once installed, the touch screen interface works flawlesslly and screen color is unchanged.  The protector has been installed for less than an hour, and I can't speak to the product's durability.

The overall margin of error to install this kit accurately is extremely narrow, especially for an individual who has never emplaced a screen protector before. If the kit included a second screen protector, the process would be far more forgivable. Due to the installation challenges and, more importantly, the absence of a second piece off glass, I highly recommend looking for a different product.",0
1578434751-4805,Tanya G.,Super easy to apply - just follow all the steps!,"This is the first screen protector I’ve used that I had no problems installing.  No matter what, I’ve always ended up with air bubbles or dust particles appearing no matter how many times I’ve cleaned the screen prior to use.  Don’t rush through applying this!  It’s hard not to get antsy and just skip steps, but going through everything will ensure you get a clean application.  Best tip I heard and used: apply in a bathroom and run the shower to create some humidity.  Apparently this helps not to attract dust or lint to the screen.

There’s also no glare that I notice, which I really like.  Overall, really happy with this screen protector.",1

I took packaging tape, folder first quarter over onto itself, stuck the rest to each end of the non-sticky side of the screen protector, removed after I had the screen protector on the iPad. The second one I used the guide stickers, which failed just as I flipped the screen protector onto the iPad......which meant I had to lift to reposition it. The seller worked with me to get this fixed, as the screen protector now had spots that would not re-stick. Awesome seller and awesome product.....if you don't use the guide stickers.",1

1578434744-4780,Danielle D.,but would be happier if it lined up better on the iPad,"Found the product to be a little challenging to put on the iPad. The stickers provided to help line it up do not stick very well (or at all) so when I went to do the final placement the protector moved and the end result is an unevenly placed screen protector. I did end up with one bubble, but I lifted the corner again and it went away. The final result is ok, but would be happier if it lined up better on the iPad. I'll use it for awhile and then replace with a different brand at a later date.

*update: shortly after writing the review, I was contacted by the company and they sent me a replacement free of charge. I have updated from two to three stars based on their customer service.

No I did not have it near anything that could possibly attract the lint. I did it on a table after washing my hands to make sure I attracted no lint and still there ended up being some. I returned product and am purchasing a different brand.

Revised (04/17/2018). Great customer service I'll say that much. I was sent a free replacement to help make my experience better than it had been the first go round. However, I didn't notice until I was looking at the new glass cover I received that the camera is covered up by the glass. I didn't like that and don't know how well you can still see if the glass covers the camera. I had already purchased a new screen cover from the same brand that I purchased from for my Nintendo Switch. That did not cover my camera and was beyond easy to use so.... I didn't use the new cover and probably won't since I already have one on it. So if you don't mind covering your camera on the front of the iPad then maybe it will work for you. Otherwise other brands have the camera cutout.",0

The installation instructions are straightforward and easy to follow.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that the three stickers which are supposed to be used as a hinge during the installation process (a process which I have successfully followed on other screen protectors) were not adhesive enough.  I tried a second time, this time doing my best to press the stickers firmly onto the protector and my iPad, but they still came loose as I swung the screen protector and attempted to remove the protective layer.  In the end, I simply applied the screen protector by eye, and then removed and re-applied when I found it to be slightly off-center.  Overall, I feel it is a very good glass protector, and could only benefit from a more adhesive set of hinge stickers.",1

1578434864-5239,MGL,doesn't install well - lots of bubbles that don't go away,"doesn't work nearly as well as other glass screen protectors that i have tried.  Their sticker hinge approach does work as the stickers don't stick well enough.  The glass doesn't go on smoothly as it creates a lot of bubbles that don't go away.  You get what you pay for as this is cheaper than Zagg, but isn't anywhere near the quality or ease of application",0

1578435058-5959,S. Ware,A Must Buy...Buy It! Buy It! Buy It!,This is a very good glass. I have cracked it a little though. It still looks good. It's the best looking screen protector I have ever bought for a tablet. I think it does well with fingerprints also. It will show fingerprints but I feel that it shows less than others and it is so clear that it looks like the regular screen!,1

I received an email from the seller which told me to watch a youtube install video; that made it SO simple! Its a great screen protecter, I have to work on one small bubble off to the side, but the other couple bubbles pushed right out. What I really liked was the personalized email from this seller.  Was so much easier than what I thought it would be.  Awesome! 5 STARS!!",1
1578435353-7045,Mallory Speiser,Getting this to come,this is the second time I buy this product. The first time it worked perfectly. This time around I couldn’t get the bubbles out to save my life and I am very OCD and do things methodically exactly like the instructions. Now I have to live with these two bottles every time I stare at this iPad.,0

1578434687-4566,Bryan,Nice protector and so easy to apply.,"Should have purchased this ages ago, before my iPad Air 2 got a hairline crack on the screen. Lucky for me, while the crack was not attractive it didn't create any issues with usability. Checked about getting it fixed but a replacement screen cost almost as much as a refurbished iPad. Since the crack was barely noticeable, decided to get a screen protector to guard against any further damage. Saw many comments warning against using a screen protector after a crack, but followed the instructions (both the booklet and the YouTube video) and it went on easily, without any bubbles. There was a little air pocket that formed along the crack but I used my fingers and the enclosed squeegee to get rid of that. Happy with the Sparin Tempered Glass Screen Protector, and feel confident it will help maintain the integrity of my screen.",1

1578434661-4475,dudalth91,Fast delivery? maybe. Durable? no.,"I purchased this soon as I got my iPad without much searching because I wanted to have a screen protector delivered as soon as possible. Maybe I should have researched it a bit more before deciding to purchase it. It came in a very nicely packaged sturdy looking case with hardcover and styrofoam on all sides. On the third day of using it, I dropped my iPad (from maybe 2 1/2 ~ 3in height to my desk) and it cracked.  I should have learned my lesson from the first one but I didn't. So I purchased the second one. Thankfully it didn't crack BUT I just noticed that near one of the corner was chipped. I haven't dropped it nor given any damages (that I remember of) so I am very curious as to how it chipped and it's slowly making itself larger.
I would have said it may not be for me but people who don't take their iPad outside should be fine BUT I am one of those people who doesn't take their iPad outside of home. So would I recommend this one to a friend? No.
Who would I recommend this to? people who need cheap protector quickly as they are looking for a higher quality one. Like I said before, the package was very nicely packaged and it came very quickly.",0

1578435157-6340,Andres Rojas,follow directions as instructed,bought it for my new Ipad and set it up correctly and it looked great. Problem came when i tried taking the bubbles out some of the middle ones didn't budge so i made the mistake of lifting the screen again and placing it down. The protector started to gather random particles which made it worse. Its a shame since it looked good with it on,0

1578434806-5015,Deb,Handle It Carefully!,Please remember to handle very carefully until you get it installed. I broke the first one of these that taught me a lesson. I did have a couple of bubbles and it took several weeks for all of them to go away. They didn’t bother even when they were still there. Doesn’t interfere with touch screen sensitivity either.,1
1578434962-5601,Alan,Great customer service and product,"I'm very careful in applying screen protectors; I've applied 3 of them to my phones before trying to apply one to the iPad.  That was helpful experience, because the larger the screen protector, the more difficult it is to make it line up *precisely* with the button and the edges of the screen.

The first Sparin screen protector that I received had a problem.  There were two bubbles (about 1/8"" in diameter) that wouldn't go away no matter what I did. Looking very closely, they had tiny concentric circles inside them.  I emailed Sparin.  They didn't reply immediately, but apologized in the email that arrived a couple of days later for being so late, and about 2 days later they had a brand new replacement screen protector in my mailbox.  Great customer service!  The replacement had no defects and applied perfectly.

One of the things I really like about this screen protector is that my finger glides across its surface easier than it glides across the iPad's original glass.  It's probably the oleophobic (oil-repellent) coating.  Whatever the reason, swiping across the screen is easier than it was when I had no screen protector.  It feels better.  There's less resistance to each swipe, which makes using the iPad a more pleasant experience.",1
